1. Get the raw data as described in the "Image Acquisition and Figure Generation" section of the appendix.

2. Create a new folder called "stimulated_emission_imaging-data" in the same root folder as "stimulated_emission_imaging-master".

3. Put the unzipped data folders inside this new folder. For example, if the path to "stimulated_emission_imaging-master" is:

"\parent_folder\stimulated_emission_imaging-master"

then the path to an unzipped data folder should be:

"\parent_folder\stimulated_emission_imaging-data\2016_11_02_STE_z_stack_depletion"

4. Run the figure generation python code.
