# Stimulated Emission Imaging paper
View it in action here:

This repository is intended to hold a (mostly) self-contained scientific publication. It contains:

* HTML, javascript, and small images (index.html, and in the javascript and images directories)
* Code that produces figures (in the `figure_generation` directory)

Some files aren't suitable for version control, (e.g. raw data, large numbers of pre-rendered figure images, etc). These are stored in (link to Zenodo)

Hopefully this makes it easier to nuke the version control history for big, non-text files without risking the small, important text-based files stored here.
