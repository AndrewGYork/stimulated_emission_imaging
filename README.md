# A template for writing scientific papers
View it in action here:
https://andrewgyork.github.io/publication-template/

This repository is intended to hold a (mostly) self-contained scientific publication. It contains:

* HTML, javascript, and small images (index.html, and in the javascript and images directories)
* Code which produces figures (in the `figure_code` directory)

Some files aren't suitable for version control, (e.g. raw data, large numbers of pre-rendered figure images, etc). These are stored in a sister repository:

https://github.com/AndrewGYork/publication-template-data

Hopefully this makes it easier to nuke the version control history for big, non-text files without risking the small, important text-based files stored here.
