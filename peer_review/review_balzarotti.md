To discard for good the photothermal effects I would:

* Use nanosecond pulsed exc. and sted beams and shift them. Thermal effects "should not go that fast", but I would make sure and estimate the order of magnitude of thermal relaxation in whatever media is holding the bead.

* I would check the bead absorption before and after bleaching. If it doesn't change it helps your hypothesis. Of course, this is not so easy to measure (the absorption at the sted wavelength). But the general spectral should help.

* Bulk NV centers will not have any bead, just the dipole sitting in a high thermally conductive diamond.

There is the issue of the index matching. As you can actually measure phase contrast, it means that the index of the beads is not *perfectly* matched. This means that there is some scattering and, therefore, the field affecting the fluorophores (and inducing the stim. emission) is the sum of the incident plus scattered fields. So, if the 'sted follows the same wavefunction' dogma is true, the stim. emitted photon will copy the scattered field and you would actually measure something on your detector. Bottom line: Get rid of the index mismatch, with the bulk NV centers, or something like that.
