1. My experience is that, in the context of stimulated emission, NV centers in bulk have different behavior than nanodiamonds. I suggest using a single NV center: closer to a single(emitter)-molecule, but more photostable.

2. Also with fluorescent beads, I often found behaviors that I cannot explain considering only the stimulated emission process. Fluorescent beads show self-quenching, heating, etc. References: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0054421 and https://doi.org/10.1002/jbio.201800315.

3. Also, organic single-molecule when irradiated with a beam that should induce stimulated emission, may behave differently e.g., reverse intersystem crossing is likely to occur. Again single NV center in bulk is probably the best sample.

4. Using pulsed (hundred ps) lasers, it is possible implementing a pump (excitation) and probe (stimulated-emission) experiment. Delaying the probe within the lifetime of the emitter, the stimulated emission (as the fluorescence) should change exponentially (lifetime rate). This experiment requires pulsed lasers, but not a time-resolved detector, i.e. a conventional camera can be used. It allows understanding if the recorded signal is stimulated emission without changing much of the experiment conditions (such as heating).
