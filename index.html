<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p class="abstract">We demonstrate experimental evidence that stimulated emission from a point-like emitter is distinguishable from the stimulating beam. The emission propagates spherically and coherently interferes with the stimulating beam. Imaging via stimulated emission could potentially combine the high signal rates of transmitted light microscopy with the specificity of fluorescence microscopy.</p>

<h3>
Introduction</h3>

<p><strong>Fluorescence is useful</strong>Fluorescence is a widely-used tool in biological research. Fluorescent dyes and genetically-expressed fluorescent proteins help scientists determine the structure of organelles, track intra-cellular activity, quantify protein expression and distribution, sequence genes, and measure concentration of chemicals.
</p>

<p><strong>Rate constant limit</strong>Fluorescence is the emission of light from an energetically excited material as it spontaneously decays to a lower energy state

[<a class="citation" href="http://inspirehep.net/record/858448/files/eng.pdf" title="Einstein, A. &quot;On the quantum theory of radiation.&quot; Phys Z 18, 121 (1917).">Einstein 1917</a>].

For a group of \(N\) fluorophores, the total emission rate is \(n_2N/\tau_{fluor}\), where \(n_2\) is the fraction of the population in the excited state and \(1/\tau_{fluor}\) is the spontaneous emission rate constant

The genetically expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the Alexa Fluor 488 dye have \(\tau_{fluor}\) of 3.2 ns and 4.0 ns, respectively

\(\tau_{fluor}\) depends on the environment (e.g. pH, temperature), but for typical fluorophores used in microscopy, \(\tau_{fluor}\) ranges from 0.5 ns to 5 ns

and is not easily tuned.
</p>

<p><strong>Concentration--> rate limit</strong>The accuracy of a fluorescence measurement improves as the amount of fluorescent emission increases

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-45524-2_2" title="Pawley, James B. &quot;Fundamental limits in confocal microscopy.&quot; In Handbook of Biological Confocal Microscopy, pp. 20-42. Springer US, 2006.">Pawley 2006</a>].

What are the limits on fluorescent emission? \(n_2\) is controlled by excitation power, but cannot exceed 1. \(N\) can be increased via over-expression or multiple tagging, but this often causes undesired artifacts in biological samples. Increasing exposure time increases fluorescent signal but degrades time resolution. Therefore, a fixed \(\tau_{fluor}\) represents a practical limit to our ability to resolve fast sub-cellular dynamics, especially when quantifying low-abundance proteins or viewing structures whose function is impaired by excessive fluorescent tagging.
</p

<p><strong>Stimulated emission faster rate</strong>Stimulated emission, an alternative radiative decay process, is the emission of light from an energetically excited material, triggered by light applied to the material 

[<a class="citation" href="http://inspirehep.net/record/858448/files/eng.pdf" title="Einstein, A. &quot;On the quantum theory of radiation.&quot; Phys Z 18, 121 (1917).">Einstein 1917</a>].

The rate of stimulated emission is \(h_{stim}\sigma_{23}n_2N\), where \(h_{stim}\) is the intensity of the stimulating light and \(\sigma_{23}\) is the cross-section for the optical transition

[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OL.19.000780" title="Hell, Stefan W., and Jan Wichmann. &quot;Breaking the diffraction resolution limit by stimulated emission: stimulated-emission-depletion fluorescence microscopy.&quot; Optics letters 19, no. 11 (1994): 780-782.">Hell 1994</a>].

Unlike spontaneous emission, the stimulated emission rate constant \(h_{stim}\sigma_{23}\) is easily tuned over a large range by changing the stimulating light intensity \(h_{stim}\). A stimulation intensity of ~200 mW/&micro;m<sup>2</sup> results in \(h_{stim}\sigma_{23}\) roughly equal to \(1/\tau_{fluor}\)

[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth1108" title="Willig, Katrin I., Benjamin Harke, Rebecca Medda, and Stefan W. Hell. &quot;STED microscopy with continuous wave beams.&quot; Nature methods 4, no. 11 (2007): 915-918.">Willig 2007</a>],

while pulsed stimulating light with similar average power yields \(h_{stim}\sigma_{23}\) three orders of magnitude larger than \(1/\tau_{fluor}\)

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.163901" title="Dyba, Marcus, and Stefan W. Hell. &quot;Focal spots of size ?/23 open up far-field florescence microscopy at 33 nm axial resolution.&quot; Physical review letters 88, no. 16 (2002): 163901.">Dyba 2000</a>].

</p>

<p><strong>Ask the question</strong>A fixed spontaneous emission rate constant \(1/\tau_{fluor}\) limits the speed of fluorescent imaging. Given that the stimulated emission rate constant \(h_{stim}\sigma_{23}\) can be orders of magnitude higher, can we use stimulated emission to take images orders of magnitude faster than fluorescence images? Consider the animated thought experiment shown in Figure 1a below.

<figcaption><strong>EDIT THIS Figure 1 (A): What should imaging stimulated emission look like?</strong> A green light pulse excites a point fluorophore (small circle, left). A red light pulse then comes into contact with the excited fluorophore and causes it to optically emit. The dark-field beam block completely attenuates the stimulating beam. Where will the stimulated emission go, and will it form an image? With <code>Microscope type: Phase contrast</code> selected, the dark-field beam block is replaced with a partially transmissive phase delay optic.</figcaption>
</figure><p></p>

<p><strong>describe the figure and reinforce the question</strong>In Figure 1a, a single fluorophore (small circle, left) is energetically excited by a pulse of green light. Next, a pulse of red light stimulates the fluorophore to emit this energy as red light. A small, opaque beam block (black rectangle, center) absorbs the stimulating pulse (Fig. 1a with <code>Microscope type: Dark-field</code> selected). Where will the stimulated emission go? Will any of it reach the camera? Will it form an image of the fluorophore on the camera? More generally, what is the shape in space and time of stimulated emission from an isolated, point-like emitter?
</p>

<p>In their 1964 Nobel lectures on stimulated emission, Townes and Prokhorov remarked:
</p>

<blockquote>"... [stimulated emission] has the same field distribution and frequency as the stimulating radiation..."

[<a class="citation" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1964/townes-lecture.html" title="Charles H. Townes. &quot;Nobel Lecture: Production of Coherent Radiation by Atoms and Molecules.&quot; (1964) Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2014. Web. 28 Nov 2017">Townes 1964</a>]

</blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote>"... stimulated emission occurs when an excited atom emits due to interaction with an external field (quantum). Then two quanta are involved: one is the external one, the other is emitted by the atom itself. Those two quanta are indistinguishable, i.e. their frequency and directivity coincide."

[<a class="citation" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1964/prokhorov-lecture.html" title="Aleksandr M. Prokhorov. &quot;Nobel Lecture: Quantum Electronics.&quot; (1964) Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2014. Web. 28 Nov 2017">Prokhorov 1964</a>]

</blockquote><p></p>

<p>Half a century later, this is still our understanding of stimulated emission:
</p>

<blockquote>"... in this process, called stimulated emission, a photon encountering an excited molecule produces a copy of itself, thus adding another photon of the same colour and propagation direction to the beam."

[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/4611069a" title="Hell, Stefan W., and Eva Rittweger. &quot;Microscopy: Light from the dark.&quot; Nature 461, no. 7267 (2009): 1069-1070.">Hell 2009</a>]

</blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote>"An atom or molecule in its excited state can be stimulated down to the ground state by an incident light field, resulting in the creation of a new coherent photon identical to those in the original incident field."

[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature08438" title="Min, Wei, Sijia Lu, Shasha Chong, Rahul Roy, Gary Holtom, and Xiaoliang Sunney Xie. &quot;Imaging chromophores with undetectable fluorescence by stimulated emission microscopy.&quot; (2009).">Min 2009</a>]

</blockquote><p></p>

<p><strong>first answer: same field distribution</strong>If stimulated emission has the same field distribution as the stimulating radiation, then perhaps the shape of the stimulated emission in space and time is identical to and indistinguishable from that of the stimulating beam, as illustrated in Figure 1b below.

<figcaption><strong>EDIT THIS Figure 1 (B): Stimulated emission does not contain information about the location of its source if it is indistinguishable from the the incoming beam.</strong> This animation shows stimulated emission cannot be imaged if it is indistinguishable from the collimated stimulating beam. A green light pulse excites a point fluorophore (small circle, left). A red light pulse then comes into contact with the excited fluorophore and causes it to optically emit, which in turn amplifies the entire beam. The dark-field beam block completely attenuates the amplified stimulating beam. With <code>Microscope type: Phase contrast</code> selected, the dark-field beam block is replaced with a partially transmissive phase delay optic. In phase contrast mode, the attenuated emission is collimated when it reaches the camera and contains no information about the location of the fluorophore.</figcaption>
</figure><p></p>


<p><strong>same field distribution implications: does not contain info about location and violates causality</strong>In this model, the energy originating from the fluorophore is spread evenly over the stimulating pulse (indicated in Fig. 1b by a stronger red color). Like the stimulating pulse, the stimulated emission is absorbed by the beam block (Fig. 1b with <code>Microscope type: Dark-field</code> selected), and none of it reaches the camera. Even without the beam block, the stimulated emission would not form an image of the fluorophore on the camera, because the shape of the stimulated emission does not depend on the location of the fluorophore. In fact, this model predicts that no information about the fluorophore's position is encoded in the stimulated emission. Finally, note that if the field of the stimulating pulse is well-collimated (meaning it has a well-defined direction of propagation, and therefore flat phase fronts with a large lateral extent), then the same will be true of the field of the stimulated emission. It is not obvious how this emitted field obeys causality.
</p>

<p><strong>pivot from violation of causality to suggest point-like emission</strong>In Fig. 1b, when the center of the stimulating pulse contacts the excited fluorophore, the top and bottom edges of the stimulating pulse immediately become brighter. How can a point-like source instantaneously generate an electromagnetic field a large distance from its position?
</p>

<blockquote>"... an effect observed at the point \(\vec{x}\) at time \(t\) is caused by the action of a source a distance \(R\) away at an earlier or retarded time, \(t'=t-R/c\)."

</blockquote><p></p>

<p>If stimulated emission occurs during the stimulating pulse duration \(\Delta t\), then the effects of stimulated emission must lie on an expanding spherical shell with outer/inner radius \(c(t \pm \Delta t/2)\), as illustrated in Fig. 1c below.

<figcaption><strong>EDIT THIS Figure 1 (C): Stimulated emission can be imaged if it propagates multi-directionally.</strong> This animation shows stimulated emission can be imaged if it propagates from its source in a direction distinct from the stimulating beam. A green light pulse excites a point fluorophore (small circle, left). A red light pulse then comes into contact with the excited fluorophore and causes it to optically emit. The dark-field beam block completely attenuates the stimulating beam and transmits part of the stimulated emission. The stimulated emission continues to form an image on the camera. With <code>Microscope type: Phase contrast</code> selected, the dark-field beam block is replaced with a partially transmissive phase delay optic. In phase contrast mode, the attenuated stimulating beam is collimated when it reaches the camera and coherently interferes with the stimulated emission to form a phase contrast image.</figcaption>
</figure><p></p>

<p><strong>implications of point-like emission: different "directivity," contains location info, does not appear to violate causality, coherence (multiple emitters or suggest coherent background)</strong>In this model, the energy originating from the fluorophore propagates spherically outwards. Unlike the stimulating pulse, some of the stimulated emission continues past the beam block and forms an image of the fluorophore on the camera (Fig. 1c with <code>Microscope type: Dark-field</code> selected). If an attenuating beam block is substituted for the opaque one (Fig. 1c with <code>Microscope type: Phase contrast</code> selected), the attenuated stimulating pulse forms a uniform background on the camera that coherently interferes with the stimulated emission. While this model describes stimulated emission that is causally related to its source, it is not obvious how the spherical stimulated emission can be considered to have the same field distribution

<p><strong>point-like emission theory/experiment... what would the detector see?</strong>The light path depicted in Fig. 1c potentially allows faster imaging via stimulated emission; the one in Fig. 1b does not. How shall we decide if either model accurately describes the shape in space and time of stimulated emission from an isolated, point-like emitter?

theoretically explored a related question by modeling point-like stimulated emitters as classical oscillating dipoles. This reasonable assumption is consistent with the model in Fig. 1c, but to our knowledge, no experimental work has directly tested it.

<p>Min and Dellwig proposed stimulated emission as an improved contrast mechanism compared to fluorescence, and they imaged fluorophores in biological samples via stimulated emission

They assumed that stimulated emission is indistinguishable from the stimulating beam (consistent with the model in Fig. 1b.) and used single-pixel detection to measure the change in intensity of the stimulating beam due to stimulated emission. Unfortunately, such measurements do not reveal the shape of stimulated emission, making it difficult to rule out Fig. 1b or 1c.
</p>

<p>Gather and Chen used fluorescently labeled cells as the gain medium of an optically excited laser cavity, and imaged the stimulated emission onto a multi-pixel detector

Their stimulating beam shape was determined by a complicated combination of cavity feedback, sample refractive index, and fluorophore distribution. Since they simultaneously measured the stimulating beam and the stimulated emission, but did not separately characterize their shapes, it is similarly difficult to rule out Fig. 1b or 1c based on these measurements.
</p>

<p><strong>we did dark-field and phase contrast</strong>Since we were unable to find existing literature that unambiguously predicts what the detector in Figure 1a would see, we performed the experiment. We imaged stimulated emission from nitrogen-vacancy (N-v) centers in nanodiamonds and from fluorescent polystyrene beads, in a setup similar to the one depicted in Figure 1a. We used dark-field microscopy (Figure 1a with <code>Microscope type: Dark-field</code> selected) and phase contrast microscopy (Figure 1a with <code>Microscope type: Phase contrast</code> selected). Our results are consistent with Figure 1c's prediction, suggesting that stimulated emission from a point-like source propagates spherically and is distinguishable from the stimulation beam.
</p>

<h3>
Experimental design</h3>
<p><strong>wavelength, magnification, max intensity</strong>Figure 2 shows a photograph and schematic of our experimental setup. The microscope's collection path has three relay lens pairs, which result in 750X total magnification. The sample is illuminated by two continuous wave lasers (532 nm wavelength for excitation and 721 nm for stimulation), each gated to ~1.25 &micro;s pulse duration via acousto-optic modulators.  The peak excitation intensity is 4 MW/cm<sup>2</sup> and the peak stimulation intensity is 1 MW/cm<sup>2</sup>. For convenience, we chose to deliver the excitation beam parallel to the stimulation beam, rather than perpendicular as in Figure 1a. The sample is positioned at the ~10 &micro;m diameter illumination beam waists, which are 36 times wider than the ~280 nm diffraction-limited spot size of the collection path. The stimulating beam takes up ~1/36 of the full NA of the objective lens, and therefore illuminates ~1/1300 of the area of the back focal plane. This means that, as in Figure 1c, the light emitted from a point in the image plane and light in the stimulating beam are separately addressable in the back focal plane..

<p><strong>filters</strong>For fluorescence and depletion imaging, we paired an excitation stop filter with a wide band-pass filter (600-680 nm) that stopped the excitation and stimulation beams but passed roughly half of the fluorescence from the samples. For stimulated emission imaging, we used the excitation stop filter along with a narrow (10 nm) pass filter centered at 720 nm.
</p>

<p><strong>describe darkfield and phase contrast setup</strong>For dark-field imaging, we placed a 512 &micro;m diameter chrome disk plated onto a glass substrate (Photo Sciences Inc., Torrance, CA) in the collection beam path. We axially centered the disc in the back focal plane closest to the camera. For phase contrast imaging, we replaced the chrome disc with a chrome annulus with the same 512 &micro;m outer diameter and 9 &micro;m inner diameter that allowed 0.6% of the transmitted stimulation beam to evenly fill the field of view of the camera. Additionally for phase contrast imaging, we centered a phase mask on the second back focal plane of the imaging system. The phase mask is a 0.18 &micro;m thick cover glass with a 90 &micro;m diameter hole drilled by laser (Potomac Photonics, Halethorpe, MD). This mask gives a relative phase shift between image light, which passes through the glass, and transmitted light, which passes through the hole. For highest contrast imaging, we optimized two parameters: the relative phase (by carefully changing the angle of the phase mask), and the relative magnitude of the transmitted and image light (by choosing a chrome annulus with the correct inner and outer diameter). The experimental diagram for phase contrast imaging is available in the online version of Figure 2 and also in the <a href="./appendix.html#Phase_contrast_microscope_diagram">appendix</a>.

<h3>
Fluorescence and stimulated emission depletion</h3>
<p>To confirm that we excited fluorescence in our samples and generated stimulated emission, we observed fluorescence through a wide spectral filter that discriminated against excitation and stimulation beams. Figure 3 shows fluorescence measured from N-v centers in a nanodiamond for varying excitation power and with/without the stimulation beam (the online version and <a href="./appendix.html#Crimson_dyed_polystyrene_bead_fluorescence">appendix</a> also show fluorescence from crimson dyed polystyrene beads). The N-v/crimson bead fluorescence images were taken with 700/5 simultaneous ~1.25 &micro;s stimulation and excitation laser pulses over a 420/4 ms camera exposure. The inset fluorescence images were taken with maximum excitation power, and the points on the plot indicate average brightness of the main lobe of the image. We observed increasing fluorescence with increasing excitation power, and decreased fluorescence when the stimulating beam was additionally turned on. At the maximum available excitation beam and stimulation beam powers, we observed 8% depletion for both N-v and crimson dye fluorescence. We used a four-level atom model rate equation to roughtly fit the experimental data. From this model, we estimate a maximum excitation fraction of 0.6 for both the N-v centers and the crimson dye. The fit to experimental data is not perfect; others have measured a similar N-v fluorescence saturation shape

and bleaching of the crimson dye caused difficulty in repeatably measuring fluorescence from a single bead.

<h3>
Dark-field imaging of stimulated emission</h3>

<p><strong>darkfield setup additional explanation</strong>We used dark-field imaging to attempt to image stimulated emission from N-v centers in nanodiamonds. Dark-field imaging is a technique commonly used to separate high spatial frequency light from wide-field illumination in order to enhance the signal contrast of scattered light. If stimulated emission from a point-like particle has a point-like PSF, then the spatial frequency bandwidth of the emission should be greater than that of the incident stimulating electromagnetic field, and the two fields should be separable as long as the stimulating beam is not confined to a diffraction-limited focus of the imaging system.
</p>

<p>The dark-field filter (a chrome disc in a back focal plane of our imaging system) is a high-pass filter in the Fourier domain. This means that it preferentially passes light with high spatial frequency (i.e. small features in the image plane) while attenuating transmitted light. Most of the stimulating beam does not interact with the nanodiamonds and is attenuated. The image light is comprised of the elastically scattered light from the stimulating beam incident on the nanodiamonds, and possibly stimulated emission light from the N-v centers. Both of these signals are the same color as the stimulating beam, so they both pass through the narrow (10 nm wide) emission filter centered at 720 nm wavelength. Because diamond has a relatively high refractive index of 2.4 and the nanodiamonds are large, the scattered light is very bright and can fill the dynamic range of the camera in less than 40 &micro;s.
</p>
<p><strong>describe decrease in scattered light signal</strong>When the stimulating beam alone illuminates the sample, we solely observed the scattered light image of the nanodiamond. When both the excitation beam and the stimulating beam are incident upon the sample, we observed a decrease in brightness of the scattered light image of the nanodiamond, possibly due to stimulated emission. We show this observation in Figure 4. The scattered light images are taken with 24 simultaneous stimulation and excitation laser pulses, each at peak intensity with 1 &mu;s duration, over a 15 ms camera exposure. The displayed image is an average of 200 such exposures. The decrease in brightness of the scattered light image occurs only when the excitation laser pulses are incident simultaneously with the stimulation pulses (<a href="./appendix.html#Controls_for_thermal_effects_due_to_the_excitation_laser">and not before or after</a>).

<p><strong>wtf decrease in signal</strong>The result in Figure 4 seems counterintuitive. Why would stimulated emission, which we hope to image in addition to the scattered light, make the scattered light image darker? This could happen if the scattered electric field destructively interferes with the stimulated emission electric field. Interference is possible because both stimulated emission and scattered light have a distinct phase relationship with the incident electric field.
</p>

<p><strong>why we expect destructive interference</strong>To predict this phase relationship, we start with incident electric field \(E_0e^{i\omega t + \phi_0}\), stimulated emission field \(E_{stim}e^{i\omega t + \phi_{stim}}\), and scattered field \(E_{scat}e^{i\omega t + \phi_{scat}}\). Because stimulated emission is an instantaneous process, there is no delay between the incident electric field  and the stimulated emission electric field:
<div>
	$$\begin{equation}\phi_{stim} = \phi_0 \end{equation}$$
</div>
We also know elastic scattered light has a minimum \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) phase delay with respect to the incident electric field

[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.121.3141.345" title="Zernike, Frits. &quot;How I discovered phase contrast.&quot; Science 121, no. 3141 (1955): 345-349.">Zernike 1955</a>],

and larger delay for scattering particles that do not have a sufficiently small diameter for the Rayleigh approximation \(d<<\frac{\lambda}{\pi}\), so:
<div>
	$$\begin{equation}\phi_{scat} - \phi_0 \ge \frac{\pi}{2} \end{equation}$$
</div>
Our diameter \(d\approx 100\,nm\) nanodiamonds are slightly larger than the small diameter approximation allows for \(\lambda=721\,nm\). To estimate the additional refractive phase shift, we note that the refractive index of diamond \(n_{diamond}=2.42\), while the mounting medium \(n_{oil}=1.52\), with a difference \(\Delta n_{refractive}=0.9\). The approximate phase difference due to different refractive optical path lengths is:
<div>
	$$\begin{equation}\Delta\phi_{refractive} \sim \frac{2\pi d\Delta n_{refractive}}{\lambda} \approx 0.8 \end{equation}$$
</div>
We can then estimate the relative phase between scattered and stimulated emission:
<div>
	$$\begin{equation}\Delta\phi = \phi_{scat} - \phi_{stim} \sim \frac{\pi}{2} + \Delta\phi_{refractive} \approx 2.4 \end{equation}$$
</div>
This fulfills the requirement for destructive interference:
<div>
	$$\begin{equation} \frac{\pi}{2} \lt \Delta\phi \lt \frac{3\pi}{2} \end{equation}$$
</div>

</p>

<p><strong>we did other controls</strong>We performed a series of control experiments to rule out other possible sources of decreased scattered light image brightness and ascertain that it is a hallmark of dark-field imaging of stimulated emission from N-v centers in our nanodiamonds.
</p>

<p><strong>no fluorescence effects</strong>We ruled out effects from N-v fluorescence light, since negligible fluorescence (less than one count) transmits through the narrow emission filter onto the camera with only the excitation beam on over the course of one exposure. Additionally, fluorescence due to the excitation pulse would incoherently add to the scattered light signal and appear as an increase in brightness of the image, as opposed to the decrease we observe.
</p>

<p><strong>no heating</strong>We also ruled out heating of the sample due to the excitation laser. Sufficiently energetic excitation laser pulses could preferentially heat either the nanodiamond or the surrounding medium, causing a shape change that would subtly alter the amount of scattered light observed. Such a thermal effect on scattering would persist long after the microsecond duration excitation pulses. In the control measurement where the stimulating pulse is delayed microseconds after the excitation pulse, the decrease in brightness of the scattered light disappears. These <a href="./appendix.html#Controls_for_thermal_effects_due_to_the_excitation_laser">results</a> are available in the appendix. In another control measurement, we increased the excitation pulse duration to 20 microseconds and were able to detect a scattered light image change that peaked 250 &micro;s after the end of the excitation pulse and decayed with a time constant of ~ 1 ms (see the appendix for <a href="./appendix.html#Controls_for_thermal_effects_due_to_the_excitation_laser">this data</a>). This result resembles a thermal signal [why??], and does not appear in any of the images we took while attempting to image stimulated emission.
</p>

<p><strong>power scan</strong>In another control experiment, we adjusted the power of the 1-&micro;s duration excitation and stimulation laser pulses. The stimulated emission rate outside the fully saturated regime depends on both excitation and stimulation intensity (Note that our fluorescence measurements indicate neither excitation nor stimulated emission depletion are fully saturated.). Figure 5 shows the change in brightness of the main scattered lobe for increasing excitation and stimulation beam power. For this power scan, the image acquisition and averaging parameters are the same as that for the data in Figure 3. As one would expect from stimulated emission, the signal magnitude increases with increasing excitation and stimulation power.

<p><strong>pulse length scan in appendix</strong>We performed a similar control experiment to that in Figure 5 by increasing the pulse length of the simultaneous excitation and stimulation pulses while maintaining the same amount of energy per pulse. The change in scattered light signal depends on both the excitation and stimulation power, and therefore increases quadratically with decreasing excitation and stimulation pulse length. This behavior is similar to what one would expect of stimulated emission in the non-saturated regime. <a href="./appendix.html#The_image_signal_depends_on_the_intensity_of_the_excitation_and_stimulation_laser_pulses">These results</a> are available in the appendix.
</p>

<p><strong>z stack implies point-like emission</strong>If stimulated emission originates from the N-v centers distributed throughout the nanodiamonds, the PSF for both stimulated emission and scattered light should be identical. Since stimulated emission and scattering should coherently interfere, an axial scan of the brightness change of the dark-field scattered light should reveal differences, if any, between the PSF of the scattered light and the source of the brightness change. Figure 5 shows the change in brightness of the main scattered lobe at different axial positions, using maximum excitation and stimulation intensities. For this axial scan, the image acquisition and averaging parameters are the same as that for the data in Figures 3 and 4. Note that the change in brightness of the scattered light from the nanodiamond varies axially in a similar manner to the brightness of the scattered light image. This suggests that the PSF of the signal is similar to that of elastically scattered light.

Phase contrast imaging of stimulated emission</h3>

is a technique by which scattered light from the image object is allowed to interfere with transmitted light, unlike dark-field imaging, which solely attempts to minimize transmitted light. When the interference between transmitted and scattered light is maximized, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the scattered light is limited only by the dynamic range of the detector. Because stimulated emission, like scattered light, is coherent, phase contrast imaging could be an ideal technique to explore the coherence of the signal we measured in the dark-field imaging scheme. We adapted our setup to attempt phase contrast imaging as described in the experimental design section.
</p>

<p><strong>nanodiamonds not ideal</strong>Nanodiamonds doped with N-v centers are not an ideal candidate for phase contrast imaging of stimulated emission. In dark-field imaging of the nanodiamonds, the magnitude of the elastically scattered light dominates that of the signal we hope to be stimulated emission. The scattered light is coherent, so in phase contrast imaging, the magnitude of the interference term between the transmitted light background and the scattered light would still dominate that between transmitted light and stimulated emission. As with the dark-field results discussed earlier, any stimulated emission would be visible only as a small perturbation of the scattered light signal. We experimentally confirmed this hypothesis, and have made the <a href="./appendix.html#Phase_contrast_imaging_of_a_nanodiamond_doped_with_N-v_centers">results</a> available in the appendix.
</p>

<p><strong>index matching beads and description of result</strong>One way to minimize scattered light without decreasing stimulated emission is to match the refractive index of the mounting medium to that of the fluorescent objects. Index matching media are not readily available for diamond particles (\(n=2.42\)), but off-the-shelf matching media

are available for imaging standards with lower refractive index, such as polystyrene beads (\(n\approx 1.6\)). We used the phase contrast imaging system to empirically determine the fractional mixture of different mounting media to minimize scattered light from crimson dyed polystyrene beads (please see supp mat for procedure). We then measured phase contrast images of the index-matched beads. In Figure 7, we show phase contrast images of the crimson beads embedded in different mixtures of index matching media, as well as the change of the the scattered and transmitted light background due to excitation of the crimson dye. We tilted the phase plate to two angles that maximally enhanced the signal contrast, one of which caused the sign of the excitation-related signal to reverse. As expected, if the phase contrast image of the bead's scattered light was barely visible, the sign of the scattered light signal was also reversed by the rotated phase plate. The phase contrast images were taken with 5 simultaneous stimulation and excitation laser pulses, each at peak intensity with 1 &mu;s duration, over a 4 ms camera exposure. The displayed images are an average of two camera exposures.

<figcaption><strong>Figure 7: Phase contrast images of coherent emission from crimson dyed polystyrene beads.</strong> The top three images are of crimson dyed polystyrene beads in different index matching media. The left bead is embedded in mounting medium with refractive index ~0.06 less than that of the bead. The center bead is index-mateched, and the right bead is embedded in mounting medum with index ~0.02 greater than that of the bead. All images appear atop a ~20,000 count transmitted light background. Below each phase contrast bead image is the change in the image due to excitation of the dye. This persists even when scattered light from the bead is eliminated. In the online version of this paper, the relative phase of the image light and the transmitted light can be adjusted in order to show that the signal due to excitation coherently interferes with transmitted light. Scale bar: 250 nm. This figure's images were generated by <code>/figure_generation/figure_7.py</code>.</figcaption>
</figure><p></p>

<p><strong>bead signal seems like stim emission</strong>The signal we measured requires the excitation beam and it appears coherent: it can constructively and destructively interfere with the coherent transmitted light background. We would expect stimulated emission to also have these two characteristics. 
</p>

<p><strong>pulse length scan for beads in appendix</strong>As with the change in scattered light signal from N-v centers in nanodiamonds, the magnitude of the signal from the crimson dyed beads <a href="./appendix.html#The_image_signal_depends_on_the_intensity_of_the_excitation_and_stimulation_laser_pulses">increases linearly</a> as excitation and stimulation intensity increases and fluence is held constant. We would expect this of stimulated emission from crimson dyed beads in the regime where neither excitation nor stimulated emission are fully saturated.
</p>

<p><strong>photobleaching beads</strong>Unlike N-v centers, the crimson fluorescent dye in the polystyrene beads photobleaches after prologed excitation. If the coherent emission we measured is stimulated emission, we would expect it to decrease as well after prolonged excitation. We performed this control measurement while keeping the phase plate at an angle that caused the signal to constructively interfere with the transmitted light background. Figure 8 shows this signal decreasing after long exposure to the excitation beam. The phase contrast images are taken with 5 simultaneous stimulation and excitation laser pulses, each at peak intensity with 1 &mu;s duration, over a 4 ms camera exposure. Each point on the graph is the average number of counts per pixel in the main lobe of an image made by averaging 100 camera exposures. The sample inset images are an average of 100 camera exposures.

<h3>
Discussion</h3>

<p><strong>seems like stim emission</strong>The point-like signal we imaged demonstrates many of the hallmarks of stimulated emission: it interferes coherently with transmitted and scattered light, it seems instantaneous (the time response is 1 &micro;s or shorter), it depends on excitation and stimulation intensity, and its brightness decreases as the fluorescent source bleaches.
</p>

<p><strong>plan to beat spont emission</strong>We have yet to demonstrate an enhanced signal rate as compared with spontaneous emission due to lack of intensity in our stimulating laser beam. We are currently building a new imaging system using higher power sub-nanosecond duration excitation and stimulation laser pulses. This system should allow us to confirm that the stimulated emission rate will outcompete the spontaneous emission rate for excitation/stimulation pulse delays that span the spontaneous emission lifetime.
</p>

<p><strong>speculate on benefits of higher emission rate</strong>There are many imaging and detection applications that could significantly benefit from the high signal rate and coherent detection capability made possible by stimulated emission. Stimulated emission may make it easier to track fast sub-cellular processes such as electrochemical impulses. These transients are currently only resolvable through the use of voltage-sensitive dyes, which have notoriously dim fluorescence. It may also become easier to visualize and quantify low-abundance proteins (e.g. transcription factors) and cellular structures tagged with dim fluorophores. While fluorophore brightness may not be the major bottleneck in next-generation genetic sequencing speed or reliability, sequencing could still benefit from the ability to squeeze more signal from fluorophores.
</p>

<p><strong>flow cytometry + imaging</strong>No saturation limit on emission would greatly aid measuring fluorophores in flow cytometry devices, which usually have only microseconds to collect as much signal as possible. Additionally, coherently detected signals do not require low read noise detectors, so one could imagine replacing the fast, low noise, point detectors currently part of flow cytometry devices with array detectors that are just as fast. Flow cytometry that outputs images instead of one-dimensional signals would break the Poisson loading limit while also measuring valuable multi-dimensional information (e.g. aggregation).
</p>

<p><strong>minimize bleaching</strong>Because stimulated emission can be extracted from an excited fluorophore in less time than spontaneous emission, the fluorophore would spend less time in the excited state for the same amount of optical output. Photobleaching, in some cases, is thought to depend on the amount of time spent in the excited state
