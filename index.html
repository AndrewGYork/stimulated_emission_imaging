<h3>
Introduction</h3>
<p>Fluorescence is a powerful and widely-used tool in biological research. Fluorescent dyes and genetically-expressed fluorescent proteins help scientists determine the structure of organelles, track intra-cellular activity, quantify protein/antibody expression and binding, sequance genes, and measure concentration of chemicals. All of this is possible in spite of the fact that fluorescence signal is weak. Fluorescence is spontaneous emission of light from an electronically excited molecule (a fluorophore), and the rate of light emitted from the fluorophore is limited by the spontaneous decay rate of the excited molecule. The excited state lifetime for a fluorophore is on the order of ~1 ns. Luckily, fluorescent light can be imaged with acceptable contrast because its limited spectral bandwidth allows efficient filtering of optical noise sources like excitation light.
</p>
<p>The slow spontaneous emission rate of fluorophores fundamentally limits our ability to quantify low-abundance cellular compounds, to view sub-cellular structures that are difficult to label, and to resolve fast sub-cellular events [examples, references]. Stimulated emission, on the other hand, is a radiative decay process that is initiated by incident light with optical frequency within the spectral bandwidth of the fluorescent emission. This process is instantaneous, and therefore can potentially be many orders of magnitude faster than spontaneous emission. Stimulated emission

The dark-field beam block attenuates the amplified stimulating beam. Any light that reaches the camera would not form an image.</figcaption>

<p>We built a microscope to test the above hypothesis. The results indicate that stimulated emission has a point-like PSF. We have coherently imaged stimulated emission from nitrogen vacancies in nanodiamonds, as well as from fluorescent dyed polystyrene beads, using dark-field microscopy and phase contrast microscopy.

<h3>
Fluorescence and stimulated emission depletion</h3>
<p>To confirm that we are exciting fluorescence in our samples and generating stimulated emission, we observed fluorescence through a wide spectral filter that discriminates against excitation and stimulation beams. Figure 3 shows fluorescence measured from N-v centers in a nanodiamond for varying excitation power and with/without the stimulation beam. The exposure parameters are [insert here]. We see increasing fluorescence with increasing excitation power, and decreased fluorescence when the stimulating beam is introduced (the online version also shows fluorescence and depletion from crimson dyed polystyrene beads). The At the maximum excitation beam and stimulation beam powers, we observe 10% depletion of N-v fluorescence, and 8% for crimson dye. We used a three-level atom model rate equation to roughtly fit the experimental data. From this model, we estimate a maximum excitation fraction of 0.6 for both the N-v centers and the crimson dyed beads. The fit to experimental data is not perfect; others have measured a similar N-v fluorescence saturation shape [<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nphys2770" title="Geiselmann, Michael, Renaud Marty, F. Javier García de Abajo, and Romain Quidant. &quot;Fast optical modulation of the fluorescence from a single nitrogen-vacancy centre.&quot; Nature Physics 9, no. 12 (2013).">Geiselmann 2013</a>], and bleaching of the crimson dye caused difficulty in repeatably measuring fluorescence from a single bead. The main inferences we draw from our measurement and fit are (1), that at maximum excitation beam power, we are near to the saturation regime of excitation, and (2), that the depletion of fluorescence resembles the depletion we would expect from stimulated emission. Axial views of the N-v center fluorescence from a nanodiamond are available in the supplemental material.</p>

<h3>
Dark-field imaging of stimulated emission</h3>
<p>We used dark-field imaging to attempt to image stimulated emission from N-v centers in nanodiamonds. The dark-field filter (a chrome disc in a back focal plane of our imaging system) is a high-pass filter in the Fourier domain. This means that it preferentially passes light with high spatial frequency (small PSF and features in the image plane) while attenuating transmitted light. Most of the stimulating beam does not interact with the nanodiamonds and is attenuated. The image light is comprised of stimulated emission light from the N-v centers (if stimulated emission has a point-like PSF), as well as the elastically scattered light from the stimulating beam incident on the nanodiamonds. Both of these signals are the same color as the stimulating beam, so they both pass through the narrow (10 nm wide) emission filter centered at 720 nm wavelength. Because diamond has a relatively high refractive index of 2.4 and the nanodiamonds are large, the scattered light is very bright and can easily saturate the dynamic range of the camera in less than one millisecond.
</p>
<p>When the stimulating beam alone illuminates the sample, we simply observe the scattered light image of the nanodiamond. When both the excitation beam and the stimulating beam are incident upon the sample, we observe a change in brightness of the scattered light image of the nanodiamond, possibly due to stimulated emission. We show this observation in Figure 4. The scattered light images are taken with 24 simultaneous stimulation and excitation laser pulses, each at peak intensity with 1-&mu;s duration, over a 15 ms camera exposure. The displayed image is an average of 200 such exposures. Stimulated emission occurs when the excitation laser pulses (peak excitation intensity) are incident simultaneously with the stimulation pulses.

</figure><p></p>

<p>The result in Figure 4 seems counterintuitive. Why would stimulated emission, which we hope to image in addition to the scattered light, make the scattered light image darker? We rule out N-v fluorescence light, since negligible fluorescence (less than one count) transmits through the narrow emission filter onto the camera with only the excitation beam on over the course of one exposure. Additionally, fluorescence due to the excitation pulse would incoherently add to the scattered light signal and appear as an increase in brightness of the image, as opposed to the decrease we observe.
</p>
<p>We also rule out heating of the sample due to the excitation laser. In principle, sufficiently powerful excitation light could preferentially heat either the nanodiamond or the surrounding medium, causing a shape change that would subtly alter the amount of scattered light observed. Such a thermal effect on scattering should persist long (7 milliseconds?) after the microsecond duration excitation pulses [see supp mat for thermal effects]. In the control measurement where the stimulating pulse is delayed microseconds after the excitation pulse, the decrease in brightness of the scattered light disappears [supp mat or new figure?]. It is unlikely that the excitation pulse is thermally modulating the scattered light image.
</p>

<p>But why would the [explanation for slight destructive interference].
</p>

<p>We performed other control experiments to ascertain that the hallmark of dark-field imaging of stimulated emission from N-v centers in nanodiamonds is a decrease in scattered light image brightness. Stimulated emission outside the fully saturated regime (per our fluorescence measurements) depends on both excitation and stimulation intensity. Figure 5 shows the change in brightness of the main scattered lobe for different excitation and stimulation intensities. For this power scan, the image acquisition and averaging parameters are the same as that for the data in Figure 3. As one would expect from stimulated emission, the signal magnitude increases with increasing excitation and stimulation intensity.

</p>

<p>If stimulated emission originates from the N-v centers distributed throughout the nanodiamonds, the PSF for both stimulated emission and scattered light should be identical. Since stimulated emission and scattering should coherently interfere, an axial scan of the brightness change of the dark-field scattered light should reveal differences, if any, between the PSF of the scattered light and the source of the brightness change. Figure 5 shows the change in brightness of the main scattered lobe at different axial positions, using maximum excitation and stimulation intensities. For this axial scan, the image acquisition and averaging parameters are the same as that for the data in Figures 3 and 4. Note that the change in brightness of the scattered light from the nanodiamond varies axially in a similar manner as the brightness of the scattered light image. This suggests that the PSF of the signal is similar to that of elastically scattered light.

<h3>
Phase contrast imaging of stimulated emission</h3>

<p>Phase contrast imaging is a coherent imaging technique invented by Zernike [ref] that has better theoretical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than dark-field imaging. Because stimulated emission is coherent, phase contrast imaging is an ideal technique to boost SNR compared to dark-field imaging and simple fluorescence imaging. We adapted our dark-field imaging setup to perform phase contrast imaging. Our dark-field system contained a chrome disc used as a dark-field beam block in one of the back focal planes that we replaced with a chrome annulus that allowed a small fraction of transmitted light to evenly fill the field of view of the camera. We centered a phase mask (a laser-drilled hole in a (?mm thick) piece of glass) on another back focal plane of the imaging system. This mask gives a relative phase shift between image light, which passes through the glass, and transmitted light, which passes through the hole. For highest contrast imaging, we optimized two parameters: the relative phase (by carefully changing the angle of the phase mask), and the relative magnitude of the transmitted and image light (by choosing a chrome annulus with the correct inner and outer diameter). The experimental diagram is available in the online version of Figure 2 and also in the supplementary material.
</p>

<p>Nanodiamonds doped with N-v centers are not an ideal candidate for phase contrast imaging of stimulated emission. In dark-field imaging of the nanodiamonds, the magnitude of the elastically scattered light dominates that of the signal we hope to be stimulated emission. The scattered light is coherent, so in phase contrast imaging, the magnitude of the interference term between the transmitted light background and the scattered light would still dominate that between transmitted light and stimulated emission. As with the dark-field results discussed earlier, any stimulated emission would be visible only as a small perturbation of the scattered light signal. Experimental data for this measurement is available in the supplemental material.
</p>

<p>One way to minimize scattered light without decreasing stimulated emission is to match the refractive index of the mounting medium to that of the fluorescent objects. Index matching media are not readily available for diamond particles, but off-the-shelf matching media [meltmount reference] are available for lower-index imaging standards such as polystyrene beads (n &asymp; 1.6). We used the above described phase contrast imaging system to empirically determine the fractional mixture of different mounting media to minimize scattered light from polystyrene beads infused with crimson fluorescent dye (please see supp mat for procedure). We then measured phase contrast images of the index-matched beads. In Figure 7, we show the image that appeared on top of the transmitted light background only when the N-v centers were excited. We tilted the phase plate to two angles that maximally enhanced the signal contrast, one of which caused the sign of the signal to reverse. The phase contrast images are taken with 5 simultaneous stimulation and excitation laser pulses, each at peak intensity with 1-&mu;s duration, over a 4 ms camera exposure. The displayed images are an average of two camera exposures.

<figcaption><strong>Figure 7: Phase contrast images of coherent emission from crimson dyed polystyrene beads.</strong> The top three images are of crimson dyed polystyrene beads in different index matching media. The left bead is embedded in mounting medium with refractive index ~0.06 less than that of the bead. The center bead is index-mateched, and the right bead is embedded in mounting medum with index ~0.02 greater than that of the bead. All images appear atop a ~20,000 count transmitted light background. Below each phase contrast bead image is the change in the image due to excitation of the dye. This persists even when scattered light from the bead is eliminated. In the online version of this paper, the relative phase of the image light and the transmitted light can be adjusted in order to show that the signal due to excitation coherently interferes with transmitted light. Scale bar: 250 nm. This figure's images were generated by <code>/figure_generation/figure_7.py</code>.</figcaption>
</figure><p></p>

<p>The signal we measured requires the excitation beam and it appears coherent: it can constructively and destructively interfere with the coherent transmitted light background. We would expect stimulated emission to also have these two characteristics.
</p>

<p>Unlike N-v centers, the crimson fluorescent dye in the polystyrene beads photobleaches after prologed excitation. If the coherent emission we measured is stimulated emission, we would expect it to decrease as well after prolonged excitation. We performed this control measurement while keeping the phase plate at an angle that caused the signal to constructively interfere with the transmitted light background. Figure 8 shows this signal decreasing after long exposure to the excitation beam. The phase contrast images are taken with 5 simultaneous stimulation and excitation laser pulses, each at peak intensity with 1-&mu;s duration, over a 4 ms camera exposure. Each point on the graph is the average number of counts per pixel in the main lobe of an image made by averaging 100 camera exposures.
