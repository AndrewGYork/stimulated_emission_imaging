<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p class="abstract">We demonstrate experimental proof that stimulated emission is distinguishable from the stimulating beam. It has a point-like PSF (point spread function) and coherently interacts with the stimulating beam.</p>

<h3>
Introduction</h3>
<p>Fluorescence is a powerful and widely-used tool in biological research. Fluorescent dyes and genetically-expressed fluorescent proteins help scientists determine the structure of organelles, track intra-cellular activity, quantify protein/antibody expression and binding, sequance genes, and measure concentration of chemicals. All of this is possible in spite of the fact that fluorescence signal is weak. Fluorescence is spontaneous emission of light from an electronically excited molecule (a fluorophore), and the rate of light emitted from the fluorophore is limited by the spontaneous decay rate of the excited molecule. The excited state lifetime of a fluorophore is usually ~1-10 ns. Fortunately, fluorescent light can be imaged with acceptable contrast because its limited spectral bandwidth allows efficient filtering of optical noise sources like excitation light.
</p>
<p>The slow spontaneous emission rate of fluorophores fundamentally limits our ability to quantify low-abundance cellular compounds, to view sub-cellular structures that are difficult to label, and to resolve fast sub-cellular events. Stimulated emission is a different radiative decay process that is instantaneously initiated by incident light with optical frequency within the spectral bandwidth of the spontaneous emission [<a class="citation" title="Einstein, A. On the quantum theory of radiation. Phys Z 18, 121 (1917).">Einstein 1917</a>]. Because stimulated emission is an instantaneous process, it has a potential effective signal rate many orders of magnitude higher than that of spontaneous emission.
</p>

<p>In spite of the high signal rate, stimulated emission from fluorophores has never been imaged onto a camera. Why is that so?
</p>

<p>One good reason is that the stimulating beam is a spectrally identical background to stimulated emission and would easily flood a detector in an optical system designed to image fluorescent light. Even so, Min et al. were able to use point-scanned optical excitation and stimulation beams to resolve stimulated emission from a distribution of chromophores, which do not emit spontaneously due to faster internal non-radiative decay processes [<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature08438" title="Min, Wei, Sijia Lu, Shasha Chong, Rahul Roy, Gary Holtom, and Xiaoliang Sunney Xie. &quot;Imaging chromophores with undetectable fluorescence by stimulated emission microscopy.&quot; (2009).">Min 2009</a>]. They used lock-in averaging to resolve the signal on top of the vastly brighter background.
</p>

<p>A major reason for the dearth of attempts to image stimulated emission may also lie in our common understanding of the nature of stimulated emission, summarized below in A. M. Prokhorov's 1964 Nobel Lecture:
</p>

<blockquote>“The phenomenon of stimulated emission occurs when an excited atom emits due to interaction with an external field (quantum). Then two quanta are involved: one is the external one, the other is emitted by the atom itself. Those two quanta are indistinguishable, i.e. their frequency and directivity coincide.”
 [<a class="citation" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1964/prokhorov-lecture.html" title="Aleksandr M. Prokhorov. &quot;Nobel Lecture: Quantum Electronics.&quot; (1964) Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2014. Web.">Prokhorov 1964</a>]
</blockquote><p></p>

<p>Stimulated emission is considered indistinguishable from the stimulating beam not only in color, but in "directivity." This is true in typical laser gain media: when dense, isotropically-distributed, excited fluorophores are illuminated by a stimulating electromagnetic field that is collimated, the output constructively interferes in the forward direction and is also collmated. Collimated beams are well-approximated by plane waves, and do not contain spatial information. On the other hand, single electromagnetic emitters have a dipole-like emission pattern. When the emitters are sparseley distributed and illuminated by a plane wave, their near-spherically propagating emission can be imaged.
</p>

<p>[Monochromatic,] Wide-field imaging is fundamentally possible because dipole radiation is multi-directional, as oppsed to plane wave-like illumination, which is monodirectional. If one believes the directivity of stimulated emission, even from a single emitter, is the same as that of the stimulating beam, then one must also believe imaging stimulated emission is impossible.
</p>

<p>We disagree. We believe that stimulated emission from sub-wavelength sized particles (like fluorophores) must have a point-like emission point spread function (PSF). This has been theoretically deduced [<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.12956" title="Cray, Melissa, Mei-Li Shih, and Peter W. Milonni. &quot;Stimulated emission, absorption, and interference.&quot; American Journal of Physics 50, no. 11 (1982): 1016-1021.">Cray 1982</a>, <a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0963-9659/2/5/014" title="Vahala, Kerry J. &quot;Stimulated emission from single quantum dipoles.&quot; Pure and Applied Optics: Journal of the European Optical Society Part A 2, no. 5 (1993): 549.">Vahala 1993</a>] but not experimentally confirmed. The spatial frequency bandwidth of stimulated emission from a fluorophore should be greater than that of the incident stimulating electromagnetic field, and the two fields should be separable as long as the stimulating beam is not confined to a diffraction-limited focus of the imaging system.
</p>

<p>Dark-field microscopy [<a class="citation" title="Siedentopf, H., and R. Zsigmondy. &quot;Visualization and size measurement of ultramicroscopic particles, with special application to gold-colored ruby glass.&quot; Ann Phys 10 (1903): 1-39.">Siedentopf 1903</a>] is a technique commonly used to separate high spatial frequency light from wide-field illumination in order to enhance the signal contrast of scattered light. The animations in Figure 1 represent a dark-field imaging scheme to separate stimulated emission from the stimulating beam. In Figure 1(A), stimulated emission has a point-like PSF and can be imaged on the detector. In Figure 1(B), stimulated emission mimics the plane-wave like mode of the stimulating beam and does not reach or form an image on the detector.

A collimated green excitation pulse excites a point fluorophore. A collimated red stimulating pulse then comes into contact with the excited fluorophore and causes it to optically emit.

<figcaption><strong>Figure 1 (B): Stimulated emission cannot be imaged if it is identical to the mode of the incoming beam.</strong> This animation shows stimulated emission cannot be imaged if it joins the optical mode of the collimated stimulating beam. A collimated green excitation pulse excites a point fluorophore. A collimated red stimulating pulse then comes into contact with the excited fluorophore and causes it to optically emit, which in turn amplifies the entire beam. The dark-field beam block attenuates the amplified stimulating beam. Any light that reaches the camera would not form an image.</figcaption>
</figure><p></p>

<p>A major difference between spontaneous and stimulated emission is that stimulated emission is coherent light; it has a well-defined phase relationship [is in phase with] with the stimulating electrical field. Phase contrast imaging [<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0031-8914(42)80035-X" title="Zernike, Frits. &quot;Phase contrast, a new method for the microscopic observation of transparent objects.&quot; Physica 9, no. 7 (1942): 686-698.">Zernike 1942</a>] is a technique in which scattered light from the image object is allowed to interfere with transmitted light, unlike dark-field imaging, which attempts to minimize transmitted light. When the interference between transmitted and scattered light is maximized, the only limit on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the scattering object is the dynamic range of the detector. Because stimulated emission, like scattered light, is coherent, phase contrast imaging is an ideal technique to boost SNR compared to dark-field imaging.
</p>

<p>We built a microscope and used it in dark-field and phase contrast modalities to attempt to image stimulated emission from Nitrogen-vacancy (N-v) centers in nanodiamonds, as well as from fluorescent dyed polystyrene beads. The results indicate that stimulated emission has a point-like PSF, and that it can be detected through coherent interference with the stimulating electrical field.
</p>

<h3>
Experimental design</h3>
<p>We show the experimental setup in photograph (Figure 2A) and schematic (Figure 2B) form. The microscope has three relayed lens pairs, which result in 750X total magnification. The sample is collinearly illuminated by continuous wave (CW) lasers: 532 nm wavelength excitation and 721 nm stimulation. Each laser illuminates a 10 &micro;m 1/e diameter area of the sample, with peak excitation intensity 4 MW/cm<sup>2</sup> and peak stimulation beam intensity 1 MW/cm<sup>2</sup>.

<p>We imaged nanodiamonds doped with N-v centers and crimson fluorescent dyed beads. The excitation and stimulation laser wavelengths were chosen to match the absorption and emission spectra of both of these samples. The nanodiamonds have 80 nm average diameter (provided by Keir Neumann, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD). A representative transmission electron microscope <a href="./appendix.html#Fluorescent_samples_and_mounting">image</a> of the nanodiamonds is available in the appendix. Crimson fluorescent dyed polystyrene beads [<a class="citation" href="https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/F8806" title="FluoSpheres™ Carboxylate-Modified Microspheres, 0.2 µm, crimson fluorescent (625/645), 2% solids, Catalog # F8806">ThermoFisher</a>] have 200 nm diameter. The nanodiamonds and beads were mounted in between a 1 mm thick glass window and 0.2 mm thick cover glass. Mounting protocol <a href="./appendix.html#Fluorescent_samples_and_mounting">details</a> are also included in the appendix.
</p>

<p>For fluorescence and depletion imaging, we paired an excitation stop filter with a wide band pass filter (600-680 nm) that stops excitation and stimulation beams but passes roughly half of the fluorescence from the samples. For stimulated emission imaging, we used the excitation stop filter along with a narrow (10 nm) pass filter centered at 720 nm.
</p>

<p>For dark-field imaging, we axially centered a 512 &micro;m diameter chrome disk plated onto a glass substrate (Photo Sciences Inc., Torrance, CA) on the back focal plane closest to the camera. For phase contrast imaging, we replaced the chrome disc with a chrome annulus with the same 512 &micro;m outer diameter and 9 &micro;m inner diameter that allows 0.6% of the transmitted stimulation beam to evenly fill the field of view of the camera. Additionally for phase contrast imaging, we centered a phase mask on the second back focal plane of the imaging system. The phase mask is a 0.18 &micro;m thick cover glass with a 90 &micro;m diameter hole drilled by laser (Potomac Photonics, Halethorpe, MD). This mask gives a relative phase shift between image light, which passes through the glass, and transmitted light, which passes through the hole. For highest contrast imaging, we optimized two parameters: the relative phase (by carefully changing the angle of the phase mask), and the relative magnitude of the transmitted and image light (by choosing a chrome annulus with the correct inner and outer diameter). The experimental diagram for phase contrast imaging is available in the online version of Figure 2 and also in the <a href="./appendix.html#Phase_contrast_microscope_diagram">appendix</a>.

<h3>
Fluorescence and stimulated emission depletion</h3>
<p>To confirm that we excited fluorescence in our samples and generated stimulated emission, we observed fluorescence through a wide spectral filter that discriminates against excitation and stimulation beams. Figure 3 shows fluorescence measured from N-v centers in a nanodiamond for varying excitation power and with/without the stimulation beam (the online version and <a href="./appendix.html#Crimson_dyed_polystyrene_bead_fluorescence">appendix</a> also show fluorescence from crimson dyed polystyrene beads). The N-v/crimson bead fluorescence images are taken with 700/5 simultaneous stimulation and excitation laser pulses, each at peak intensity with 1 &mu;s duration, over a 420/4 ms camera exposure. We observe increasing fluorescence with increasing excitation power, and decreased fluorescence when the stimulating beam is introduced. The At the maximum available excitation beam and stimulation beam powers, we observe 8% depletion for both N-v and crimson dye fluorescence. We used a three-level atom model rate equation to roughtly fit the experimental data. From this model, we estimate a maximum excitation fraction of 0.6 for both the N-v centers and the crimson dye. The fit to experimental data is not perfect; others have measured a similar N-v fluorescence saturation shape [<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nphys2770" title="Geiselmann, Michael, Renaud Marty, F. Javier García de Abajo, and Romain Quidant. &quot;Fast optical modulation of the fluorescence from a single nitrogen-vacancy centre.&quot; Nature Physics 9, no. 12 (2013).">Geiselmann 2013</a>], and bleaching of the crimson dye caused difficulty in repeatably measuring fluorescence from a single bead. The main inferences we draw from our measurement and fit are (1), that at maximum excitation beam power, we are near to the saturation regime of excitation, and (2), that the depletion of fluorescence resembles the depletion we would expect from stimulated emission. An <a href="./appendix.html#Axial_view_of_fluorescence_from_a_nanodiamond_doped_with_N-v_centers">axial view</a> of the N-v center fluorescence from a nanodiamond is available in the appendix.

<h3>
Dark-field imaging of stimulated emission</h3>
<p>We used dark-field imaging to attempt to image stimulated emission from N-v centers in nanodiamonds. The dark-field filter (a chrome disc in a back focal plane of our imaging system) is a high-pass filter in the Fourier domain. This means that it preferentially passes light with high spatial frequency (small PSF and features in the image plane) while attenuating transmitted light. Most of the stimulating beam does not interact with the nanodiamonds and is attenuated. The image light is comprised of stimulated emission light from the N-v centers (if stimulated emission has a point-like PSF), as well as the elastically scattered light from the stimulating beam incident on the nanodiamonds. Both of these signals are the same color as the stimulating beam, so they both pass through the narrow (10 nm wide) emission filter centered at 720 nm wavelength. Because diamond has a relatively high refractive index of 2.4 and the nanodiamonds are large, the scattered light is very bright and can easily saturate the dynamic range of the camera in less than one millisecond.
</p>
<p>When the stimulating beam alone illuminates the sample, we simply observe the scattered light image of the nanodiamond. When both the excitation beam and the stimulating beam are incident upon the sample, we observe a decrease in brightness of the scattered light image of the nanodiamond, possibly due to stimulated emission. We show this observation in Figure 4. The scattered light images are taken with 24 simultaneous stimulation and excitation laser pulses, each at peak intensity with 1 &mu;s duration, over a 15 ms camera exposure. The displayed image is an average of 200 such exposures. The decrease in brightness of the scattered light image occurs only when the excitation laser pulses are incident simultaneously with the stimulation pulses.
</p>

</figure><p></p>

<p>The result in Figure 4 seems counterintuitive. Why would stimulated emission, which we hope to image in addition to the scattered light, make the scattered light image darker? This could happen if the scattered electric field destructively interferes with the stimulated emission electric field. Interference is possible because both stimulated emission and scattered light have a distinct phase relationship with the incident electric field.
</p>

<p>Because stimulated emission is an instantaneous process, there is no delay between the incident electric field \(E_0e^{i\omega t + \phi_0}\) and the stimulated emission electric field \(E_{stim}e^{i\omega t + \phi_{stim}}\), so \(\phi_{stim} - \phi_0 = 0\). We also know elastic Rayleigh scattered light has a minimum 90&deg; phase delay with respect to the incident electric field [<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.121.3141.345" title="Zernike, Frits. &quot;How I discovered phase contrast.&quot; Science 121, no. 3141 (1955): 345-349.">Zernike 1955</a>], and larger shift for scattering particles that do not have a sufficiently small diameter \(d<<\frac{\lambda}{\pi}\). Our nanodiamonds have \(d\approx\frac{\lambda}{\pi}\), so for a scattered electric field \(E_{scat}e^{i\omega t + \phi_{scat}}\), \(\phi_{scat} - \phi_0 = phi_{scat} - \phi_{stim}> 90^\circ\). Because of the >90&deg; phase delay between stimulated emission and scattering, the two electric fields should destructively interfere.
</p>

<p>We undertook a series of control experiments to rule out other possible sources of decreased scattered light image brightness and ascertain that it is a hallmark of dark-field imaging of stimulated emission from N-v centers in nanodiamonds.
</p>

<p>We ruled out effects from N-v fluorescence light, since negligible fluorescence (less than one count) transmits through the narrow emission filter onto the camera with only the excitation beam on over the course of one exposure. Additionally, fluorescence due to the excitation pulse would incoherently add to the scattered light signal and appear as an increase in brightness of the image, as opposed to the decrease we observe.
</p>

<p>We also ruled out heating of the sample due to the excitation laser. Sufficiently energetic excitation laser pulses could preferentially heat either the nanodiamond or the surrounding medium, causing a shape change that would subtly alter the amount of scattered light observed. Such a thermal effect on scattering would persist long after the microsecond duration excitation pulses. In the control measurement where the stimulating pulse is delayed microseconds after the excitation pulse, the decrease in brightness of the scattered light disappears. These <a href="./appendix.html#Controls_for_thermal_effects_due_to_the_excitation_laser">results</a> are available in the appendix. In another control measurement, we increased the excitation pulse duration to 20 microseconds and were able to detect a scattered light image change that decayed with a time constant of ~ 1 ms (see the appendix for <a href="./appendix.html#Controls_for_thermal_effects_due_to_the_excitation_laser">this data</a>). This result resembles a thermal signal [why??], and does not appear in any of the images we took while attempting to image stimulated emission.
</p>

<p>In another control experiment, we adjusted the power of the 1-&micro;s duration excitation and stimulation laser pulses. The stimulated emission rate outside the fully saturated regime depends on both excitation and stimulation intensity (Note that our fluorescence measurements indicate neither excitation nor stimulated emission depletion are fully saturated.). Figure 5 shows the change in brightness of the main scattered lobe for increasing excitation and stimulation beam power. For this power scan, the image acquisition and averaging parameters are the same as that for the data in Figure 3. As one would expect from stimulated emission, the signal magnitude increases with increasing excitation and stimulation power.

<figcaption><strong>Figure 5: The change in scattered light signal while red and green power is varied.</strong> The dark-field scattered light image of a nanodiamond doped with N-v centers becomes dimmer when in the presence of the excitation beam.

</figure><p></p>

<p>We performed a similar control experiment to that in Figure 5 by increasing the pulse length of the simultaneous excitation and stimulation pulses while maintaining the same amount of energy per pulse. The change in scattered light signal depends on both the excitation and stimulation power, and therefore increases quadratically with decreasing pulse length. This behavior is similar to what one would expect of stimulated emission in the non-saturated regime. <a href="./appendix.html#The_change_in_scattered_light_signal_depends_on_the_intensity_of_the_excitation_and_stimulation_laser_pulses">These results</a> are available in the appendix.
</p>

<p>If stimulated emission originates from the N-v centers distributed throughout the nanodiamonds, the PSF for both stimulated emission and scattered light should be identical. Since stimulated emission and scattering should coherently interfere, an axial scan of the brightness change of the dark-field scattered light should reveal differences, if any, between the PSF of the scattered light and the source of the brightness change. Figure 5 shows the change in brightness of the main scattered lobe at different axial positions, using maximum excitation and stimulation intensities. For this axial scan, the image acquisition and averaging parameters are the same as that for the data in Figures 3 and 4. Note that the change in brightness of the scattered light from the nanodiamond varies axially in a similar manner as the brightness of the scattered light image. This suggests that the PSF of the signal is similar to that of elastically scattered light.

Phase contrast imaging of stimulated emission</h3>

<p>Stimulated emission should coherently interfere with the stimulating beam. In order to determine the coherence of the signal we measured in the above dark-field imaging scheme, we adapted our setup to attempt phase contrast imaging as described in the Experimental Design section above.
</p>

<p>Nanodiamonds doped with N-v centers are not an ideal candidate for phase contrast imaging of stimulated emission. In dark-field imaging of the nanodiamonds, the magnitude of the elastically scattered light dominates that of the signal we hope to be stimulated emission. The scattered light is coherent, so in phase contrast imaging, the magnitude of the interference term between the transmitted light background and the scattered light would still dominate that between transmitted light and stimulated emission. As with the dark-field results discussed earlier, any stimulated emission would be visible only as a small perturbation of the scattered light signal. We experimentally confirmed this hypothesis, and have made the <a href="./appendix.html#Phase_contrast_imaging_of_a_nanodiamond_doped_with_N-v_centers">results</a> available in the appendix.
</p>

<p>One way to minimize scattered light without decreasing stimulated emission is to match the refractive index of the mounting medium to that of the fluorescent objects. Index matching media are not readily available for diamond particles, but off-the-shelf matching media [<a class="citation" href="http://www.cargille.com/meltmount.shtml" title="Cargille Mounting Media">Cargille Labs</a>] are available for imaging standards with lower refractive index, such as polystyrene beads (n &asymp; 1.6). We used the above described phase contrast imaging system to empirically determine the fractional mixture of different mounting media to minimize scattered light from crimson dyed polystyrene beads (please see supp mat for procedure). We then measured phase contrast images of the index-matched beads. In Figure 7, we show phase contrast images of the crimson beads embedded in different mixtures of index matching media, as well as the change of the the scattered and transmitted light background due to excitation of the crimson dye. We tilted the phase plate to two angles that maximally enhanced the signal contrast, one of which caused the sign of the excitation-related signal to reverse. As expected, if the phase contrast image of the bead's scattered light was barely visible, the sign of the scattered light signal was also reversed by the rotated phase plate. The phase contrast images were taken with 5 simultaneous stimulation and excitation laser pulses, each at peak intensity with 1 &mu;s duration, over a 4 ms camera exposure. The displayed images are an average of two camera exposures.

<figcaption><strong>Figure 7: Phase contrast images of coherent emission from crimson dyed polystyrene beads.</strong> The top three images are of crimson dyed polystyrene beads in different index matching media. The left bead is embedded in mounting medium with refractive index ~0.06 less than that of the bead. The center bead is index-mateched, and the right bead is embedded in mounting medum with index ~0.02 greater than that of the bead. All images appear atop a ~20,000 count transmitted light background. Below each phase contrast bead image is the change in the image due to excitation of the dye. This persists even when scattered light from the bead is eliminated. In the online version of this paper, the relative phase of the image light and the transmitted light can be adjusted in order to show that the signal due to excitation coherently interferes with transmitted light. Scale bar: 250 nm. This figure's images were generated by <code>/figure_generation/figure_7.py</code>.</figcaption>

<p>The signal we measured requires the excitation beam and it appears coherent: it can constructively and destructively interfere with the coherent transmitted light background. We would expect stimulated emission to also have these two characteristics. 
</p>

<p>As with the change in scattered light signal from N-v centers in nanodiamonds, the magnitude of the signal from the crimson dyed beads <a href="./appendix.html#The_change_in_scattered_light_signal_depends_on_the_intensity_of_the_excitation_and_stimulation_laser_pulses">increases linearly</a> as excitation and stimulation intensity increases and fluence is held constant. We would expect this of stimulated emission from crimson dyed beads in the regime where neither excitation nor stimulated emission depletion are fully saturated.
</p>

<p>Unlike N-v centers, the crimson fluorescent dye in the polystyrene beads photobleaches after prologed excitation. If the coherent emission we measured is stimulated emission, we would expect it to decrease as well after prolonged excitation. We performed this control measurement while keeping the phase plate at an angle that caused the signal to constructively interfere with the transmitted light background. Figure 8 shows this signal decreasing after long exposure to the excitation beam. The phase contrast images are taken with 5 simultaneous stimulation and excitation laser pulses, each at peak intensity with 1 &mu;s duration, over a 4 ms camera exposure. Each point on the graph is the average number of counts per pixel in the main lobe of an image made by averaging 100 camera exposures. The sample inset images are an average of 100 camera exposures.
