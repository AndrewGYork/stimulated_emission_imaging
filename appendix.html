<h3>Nanodiamond properties and mounting</h3></a>

<p>Diamond samples doped with nitrogen-vacancy (N-v) centers absorb green light, emit bright red fluorescence, and do not photobleach

[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.276.5321.2012" title="Gruber, A., A. Dräbenstedt, C. Tietz, L. Fleury, J. Wrachtrup, and C. Von Borczyskowski. &quot;Scanning confocal optical microscopy and magnetic resonance on single defect centers.&quot; Science 276, no. 5321 (1997): 2012-2014.">Gruber 1997</a>].

Figure A1 is a sample transmission electron microscope image (TEM) of nanodiamonds like the ones we imaged. The TEM image and cover glasses with mounted nanodiamonds were a kind gift from Keir Neuman (National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD). The nanodiamonds have an average diameter of ~ 80 nm, but vary widely in shape and size. The nanodiamonds were spun down for 1 minute at 10,000 rpm in a benchtop centrifuge to remove large aggregates. The supernatant was collected and mixed in 1:10 proportion with poly-lysine

(<a href="http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/biofiles/poly-lysine.html">Sigma-Aldrich</a>).

20 &micro;l of the mixture was then deposited on a cover glass rotating at 12,000 rpm in a spin coater

(<a href="http://www.laurell.com/">Laurell Technologies</a>).

We put a drop of immersion oil (Nikon Type A, n = 1.515) on the nanodiamond side of the cover and sandwiched it between the cover glass and a 1 mm thick BK7 or fused silica glass window. The circular sample is then put into the <a href="#Sample_holder" target="_self">sample holder</a> and imaged.

<h3>Fluorescent polystyrene bead properties and mounting</h3></a>

<p>We bought the 200 nm diameter crimson and orange fluorescent dyed polystyrene beads in a 2% solid solution (Thermofisher:

<a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/F8806">crimson</a>,

<a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/F8809">orange</a>).

We used a fluorometer to measure the quantum efficiency of the crimson and orange beads to be 0.255 and 0.190, respectively.
</p>

<p>To prepare the beads, we first cleaned a 1" diameter cover glass with de-ionized water and then applied a 200 &micro;L drop of poly-L-lysine solution

(<a href="http://www.emsdiasum.com/microscopy/technical/datasheet/19320.aspx">Electron Microscopy Sciences</a>)

to the center. After ten minutes, we removed as much of the poly-L-lysine as possible with a pipette, leaving an invisibly thin layer. We then washed off excess poly-L-lysine by applying 200 &micro;L de-ionized water to the center of the cover glass and immediately removing it. We then further diluted the bead solution by 3 parts in 10<sup>6</sup> with de-ionized water and added 100 &micro;L of the diluted bead solution to the center of the cover glass. We allowed the solution to remain on the cover glass for 20 minutes and then removed it with the pipette.
</p>

<p>We prepared the beads (polystyrene refractive index n ~ 1.6) in mounting media with three distinct refractive indices. The idea (as explained in the main article) is to use positive, zero, and negative refractive index to estimate the relative phase between transmitted, scattered, and stimulated light. We used commercially available mounting media with refractive index <a href="#meltmount_1539" target="_self">1.539</a>, <a href="#meltmount_1582" target="_self">1.582</a> and <a href="#meltmount_1605" target="_self">1.605</a>. For index-matched beads, we made a 1:1 mixture of the n = 1.582 and n = 1.605 mounting media in a glass beaker on a hot plate and dropped it onto a 1 mm thick, 1" diameter BK7 or fused silica glass window. We then carefully pressed the cover glass (bead side down) onto the glass window and allowed it to cool. The circular sample is then put into the <a href="#Sample_holder" target="_self">sample holder</a> and imaged. The 1:1 ratio made the beads least visible in our phase contrast microscope. We therefore estimated the refractive index of the beads to be ~ 1.594. We additionally mounted the beads in only n = 1.539 media (&Delta;n ~ 0.05) and n = 1.605 media (&Delta;n ~ -0.01).

<a id="FLIM" href="#FLIM" target="_self">
<h3>Fluorescence lifetime measurements</h3></a>
<p>We measure fluorescence lifetime of the crimson and orange dyed polystyrene beads, as well as the N-v center doped nanodiamonds, using the fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) module of a <a href="https://www.leica-microsystems.com/products/confocal-microscopes/details/product/leica-tcs-sp8/">Leica SP8 confocal microscope</a>. Excitation wavelengths were 561 nm (orange beads and nanodiamonds) and 594 nm (crimson beads), as opposed to 532 nm; these were chosen because they matched the dichroic filters of the camera that better shield the FLIM module from excitation light. The lifetime curves of the crimson and orange beads were well-fit by a single exponential function, yielding lifetimes of 2.89 &plusmn; 0.05 ns (crimson beads) and 3.85 &plusmn; 0.03 ns (orange beads). The N-v doped nanodiamonds yielded lifetime curves that could not be fit by a single exponential because of a small fast-decaying signal, but a two-exponential fit yielded a primary lifetime of 12.41 &plusmn; 0.13 ns, and a secondary lifetime of 1.135 &plusmn; 0.041 ns. The ~12 ns lifetime seemingly agrees with measurements of the excited state lifetime of N-v centers in bulk diamond

[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2013.02.001" title="Doherty, Marcus W., Neil B. Manson, Paul Delaney, Fedor Jelezko, Jörg Wrachtrup, and Lloyd CL Hollenberg. &quot;The nitrogen-vacancy colour centre in diamond.&quot; Physics Reports 528, no. 1 (2013): 1-45.">Doherty 2013</a>],

though single N-v centers in nanodiamonds with diameter less than the wavelength of fluorescent emission has been measured to be 25 ns, with the discrepancy attributed to the large difference in refractive index between the nanodiamond and its surroundings

<strong>TODO: It isn't clear to me why our measurements agree with bulk measurements.</strong>

<h3>Sample holder</h3></a>

<p>Imaging stimulated emission via our experimental setup involves using our camera to resolve signals of ~10-100 pixel counts on top of a background of ~20,000-50,000 pixel counts. Because the laser power fluctuations can exceed the signal level, averaging of images is important to be able to observe the signal. Vibration of the sample makes averaging separate images impossible. In order to combat vibration, we attempted to mount our samples as stably as possible. We secured our 1" diameter circular samples in a <a href="#lens_mount" target="_self">lens mount</a> and anchored it to a 3D stage comprised of a <a href="#vertical_stage" target="_self">manual vertical stage</a>, a <a href="#horizontal_stage" target="_self">manual horizontal stage</a>, and an <a href="#axial_stage" target="_self">axial stage</a> fitted with a <a href="#piezo_actuator" target="_self">piezoelectric actuator</a> to take automated axial stacks of the sample.
</p>

<p>The entire microscope is screwed onto a <a href="#optical_table" target="_self">floating optical table</a> for vibrational isolation from the floor. The 532 nm laser has an on-board fan that caused vibration of the sample through the optical table. In order to solve this problem, we detached the fan from the back of the laser head and anchored it to a nearby wall not in contact with the optical table. We connected the back of the laser head to the fan with a thin polyethylene bellows, which allowed the fan to continue to pull air from the laser.

<h3>Image acquisition and figure generation</h3></a>

<p>For every experiment we do that contributes to a figure, we store a copy of the python code used to control and synchronize our instruments, along with code dependencies, in the (<strong>TODO: link to data acquisition folder</strong>) folder. These files generated many raw camera images, which we have made available in a dedicated repository (<strong>TODO: link to Zenodo when it's ready</strong>). In some cases, the repository will also store exposure-averaged images (in order to decrease run-time of our figure generation code).
</p>

<p>Each figure that contains experimental data is generated by one or more python scripts (<strong>TODO link to figure generation folder</strong>). These scripts refer to the appropriate images from the data repository (<strong>TODO: link to zenodo</strong>), process the images appropriately (example: <a href="#Phase_contrast_image_generation" target="_self">phase contrast image generation</a>), generate figures, and then store those figures in svg or png format in the figures directory (<strong>TODO link to figures folder</strong>).

<h3>Phase contrast image generation</h3></a>

<a id="Phase_contrast_image_acquisition_details" href="#Phase_contrast_image_acquisition_details" target="_self">
<h4>Phase contrast image acqusition details</h4></a>
<p>We illuminate fluorescent samples comprised of dyed beads or nanodiamonds with a train of several green excitation (532 nm) laser pulses as well as several pulses of red (721 nm) light in order to stimulate emission from the samples, and we use part of the stimulation beam as a coherent background in order to generate a phase contrast image of the stimulated emission (see <a href="./index.html#Figure_2">Figure 2b</a> in the main article with <code>Imaging method: Phase contrast imaging of stimulated emission and scattered light</code> selected). The red pulses are 1.25 &micro;s in duration and are separated by 600 &micro;s. The green pulses are also 1.25 &micro;s in duration and are separated by 600 &micro;s. Because it is not clear which phase plate angle will provide the best relative background phase shift to detect the emission from the sample, we take phase contrast images of the sample for a variety of phase plate angles. For each phase plate angle, a typical measurement (<strong>TODO link to data taking program and folder?</strong>)is comprised of three sequential camera exposures:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>During the first exposure, the red pulse train precedes the green pulse train by 2.5 &micro;s. Because 600 &micro;s is much longer than the excitation lifetime, there should be no stimulated emission.</li>
  <li>During the second exposure, the red and green pulses are simultaneous. Stimulated emission should be possible.</li>
  <li>During the third exposure, the green pulse train precedes the red pulse train by 2.5 &micro;s. Because 2.5 &micro;s is much longer than the excitation lifetime, there should be no stimulated emission. If the green pulse modifies the sample in a time-delayed fashion (e.g. heating) and this effect persists longer than 2.5 &micro;s, there may be some effect on the phase contrast image.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<a id="Phase_contrast_difference_image_processing" href="#Phase_contrast_difference_image_processing" target="_self">
<h4>Phase contrast difference image processing</h4></a>

<p>The difference between the first and second exposure should let us know the effect of excitation on the phase contrast image of the beam. However, simply subtracting one image from the other is not sufficient; the red laser intensity fluctuates between those two exposures. In our image extraction code (<strong>TODO link to example figure generation code?</strong>) we re-scale the two images prior to subtraction in this manner:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>We estimate the average brightness of the red laser by averaging all phase contrast images and then finding the mean pixel value of the regions of the image that do not contain the sample particle (the background).</li>
  <li>We estimate the brightness of the red laser in each exposure by finding the mean pixel value of the background of each exposure.</li>
  <li>We re-scale each individual exposure by a factor of the ratio of the average background to its own background.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>After re-scaling all of the phase contrast images, we then subtract the first exposure from the second exposure, resulting in a "difference image" that encapsulates the effect of excitation on the phase contrast image. While we use 750x total magnification (8.7 nm/pixel) to give large dynamic range, this is not great for viewing our difference images, because intra-pixel fluctuations can appear to swamp the signal. Prior to display of the difference images, we bin 8 x 8 regions of pixels to give a more typical size (69.6 nm/pixel).
</p>

<p>Figure A5b shows a sample phase contrast image of an index-matched crimson bead prior to excitation, and the change in that image during and after excitation, based upon the experimental method and image processing steps delineated above. The phase plate angle is tuned to maximize contrast of the difference image. For each exposure, we used 8 maximum-intensity excitation/stimulation pulse pairs with 1.25 &micro;s duration and 600 &micro;s between pairs.

<a id="Extra_processing_for_phase_contrast_imaging_of_weakly_scattered_light" href="#Extra_processing_for_phase_contrast_imaging_of_weakly_scattered_light" target="_self">
<h4>Extra processing for phase contrast imaging of weakly scattered light</h4></a>

<p>While the above processing is all that is involved in generating the stimulated emission "difference images," making simple phase contrast images of scattered light from the polystyrene beads requires a few more steps. This is because there is a large, spatially inhomogeneous background variation in the simple phase contrast images due to multiple reflections in the microscope. Some of the background features appear to vary in location and brightness only when the phase plate moves ( the "stationary component"), and some features vary regardless of whether the phase plate has changed (the "non-stationary component"). The difference images are taken at a single particular phase plate angle, so they are only subject to non-stationary noise. Luckily, the non-stationary background inhomogeneities appear to vary more slowly than the camera exposure rate, so the difference images, which are the difference between adjacent exposures, are not adversely affected (This is akin to in lock-in detection.). On the other hand, because the beads are either fairly or extremely well index-matched to their mounting media, their static scattering is nearly or completely invisible atop the stationary and non-stationary background variations, and we cannot switch scattering on and off quickly enough to elude those variations.
</p>

<p>After performing overall brightness correction on the simple phase contrast bead images, we attempt to remove the stationary component from each bead image with another phase contrast image at a nearby phase plate angle at which the scattered light contrast would be minimal (least amount of constructive or destructive interference). We then note that the remaining stationary and non-stationary and components of the background noise in the phase contrast images are primarily comprised of stripes&mdash;presumably an interference pattern from multiple coherent reflections&mdash;that are completely outside of the microscope's spatial pass-band. We perform a gaussian filter on the phase contrast images to attenuate the high-frequency artifacts with almost no effect on the spatial frequencies due to the sample.
</p>

<p>We finally bin the phase contrast image pixels in the same manner as we did for the difference images. By performing these additional steps, we find it possible to image light scattered from nearly perfectly index-matched beads \((\Delta n\approx -0.01)\), as seen in <a href="./index.html#Figure_3">Figure 3 (top right panel)</a> in the main article.

<h3>Fitting to the photobleaching curve</h3></a>
<p>We performed the experiment in <a href="./index.html#Figure_4">Figure 4</a> of the main text in order to confirm that, like fluorescence, our phase contrast difference images of excited beads faded during prolonged exposure to excitation power. Although we did, indeed, find that the difference images and fluorescence images of both crimson and orange beads faded, we also found it difficult to quantify and compare the bleaching rates. A single exponential function did not fit any of the bleaching curves we acquired. Rather, we were only able to get a good fit of the fluorescence bleaching curves with a 4-exponential fit&mdash;for beads that were only excited, and for beads that were excited and depleted.
</p>

<p>In fact, many fluorophores do not have a single (mono-exponential) bleaching rate, including fluorescent dyes like Rhodamine 6G

 Because of this, we believe that the complicated bleaching rates we measured are not unusual. The most we can conclude from our measurements is that bead fluorescence and difference images co-decrease; in order to tell if one truly affects the other, we need a dual-camera setup (or at least a fast filter wheel) to monitor fluorescence and difference image decay from the same bead. <strong>TODO: mention polarization-dependent bleaching as a possible source for multi-exponential fluorescence decay</strong></p>

<h3>Delivering the same heat load to the orange beads</h3></a>

<p><strong>TODO: write this section.</strong> Our experimentally generated difference images of crimson beads in Figures 3 and 4 in the main article are consistent with the model proposed in Figure 1c: that stimulated emission emits spherically from a fluorescent point source and can by imaged through interference with the stimulating beam. However, these results may also be consistent with a model where the excitation pulse heats the bead and causes its refractive index to change. In order to discern between the two models, we imaged orange dyed polystyrene beads; this allowed us to deliver the same heat load to a bead while decreasing the expected amount of stimulated emission. We expect that if our difference images are stimulated emission images, the orange bead image should be dimmer than crimson. If our difference images are photothermal images, the orange bead image should be the same. Orange beads have a different excitation cross-section and quantum yield at our excitation wavelength (532 nm); in this section, we describe our careful attempt to expose them to the appropriate excitation power to deliver the same amount of thermal energy to the orange beadsas we did to the crimson beads.
</p>

Rhodamine (supposedly) has a QE of 0.5 at room temp in ethanol (which we used)

[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/j100334a023" title="Casey, Kelly G., and Edward L. Quitevis. &quot;Effect of solvent polarity on nonradiative processes in xanthene dyes: Rhodamine B in normal alcohols.&quot; The Journal of Physical Chemistry 92, no. 23 (1988): 6590-6594.">Casey 1988</a>].

Orange beads seem to have a QE about half of rhodamine (measuring an absolute QE is hard, so we just measure relative QE vs. rhodamine and pretend rhodamine is 0.5). Crimson beads seem to have a QE about 0.4 of rhodamine. So tentative numbers: Orange: 0.255 Crimson: 0.19
</p>

<p>At 532 nm excitation cross-section is ~10x higher for orange beads (how did we get this number? Just looking at the spectrum? Then it's 10x relative to optimal wavelength cross-section). Better estimate: use cross-sections from fluorescence plot... crimson bead excitation rate is 1.9 at 950mW, and orange excitation rate const is 3.5 at 130 mW. 3.5 * 950/130 gives max orange rate const 25.6. But that's in terms of 1/tau_fluor (or 1/tau_spont + Q). We measure the relaxation time to be 2.89 ns for crimson and 3.85 ns for orange. So if crimson relaxation rate constant is 1, then orange is 1 * (1/3.85ns)/(1/2.89ns) = 0.75. So max h_exc*sigma/(relaxation rate const) = 1.9 for crimson and 25.6 for orange, and mult by relaxation rate const ratio to get in terms of relaxation rate constant for crimson. 1.9*1 for crimson and 25.6*0.75 = 19.2. Then the ratio of the rate constants is 10.1. So very close to 10x. Quantum efficiency is also ~1.3x higher. In order to deliver the same heat load, we must lower the excitation power by a factor of 8.

Also shown is the axial projection of the change in fluorescence due to stimulated emission depletion. The images used to generate the axial projection were taken in 200 nm axial steps. There were 700 excitation/stimulation pulse pairs during each exposure, with 600 &micro;s between each pair. Each z slice in the figure is generated by averaging 20 such exposures at a single axial position and then simply averaging over the vertical dimension. We were able to generate such a projection due to the absence of photobleaching in N-v centers. Collecting the required number of fluorescence images from crimson or orange beads to make a similar axial projection is complicated by photobleaching of those dyes.

<h3>Dark-field image generation</h3></a>

<p><strong>TODO: make this section mirror the phase contrast image generation section.</strong>
</p>

<p>In our experiments, we irradiated fluorescent samples with 1 &micro;s duration excitation and stimulation laser pulses. Figure A5 shows a sample dark-field image of a N-v center-doped nanodiamond when irradiated solely by the stimulation laser pulses, along with the change in the image due to excitation laser pulses with variable delay relative to the stimulation pulses. When the excitation and stimulation pulses were simultaneous, we observed maximal decrease in brightness of the dark field scattered light image. When the stimulation pulse irradiated the sample just microseconds after the excitation pulse, we observed no change in brightness. From this, we conclude that the change in brightness occurs on a timescale faster than ~ 1 &micro;s, as we would expect from stimulated emission.

<h3>Controls for thermal effects due to the excitation laser</h3></a>

<p>In order to confirm that the change we observe in the 721 nm wavelength (red) phase contrast and darkfield images are due to coherent interference with stimulated emission, we had to rule out other possible effects of the excitation (green) laser pulse on the red image (comprised of the transmitted stimulating beam, scattered light, and stimulated emission). Stimulated emission is a fast process; it may emit from a fluorophore as long as it is in the excited state, which normally persists just nanoseconds after the excitation energy is shut off.
</p>

<p>Fast heating of our samples is a different possible explanation of the change in our phase contrast and dark-field images: the pulsed laser excitation could be absorbed by the fluorophores, and the absorbed energy could be converted into heat. A local change in temperature of the sample could change the size or refractive index of the bead or nanodiamond with respect to the surrounding media. This, in turn, would change the scattering properties of the sample and alter the scattered light image. In fact, this effect is the foundation of photothermal imaging

The fluorescent samples would have excitation-altered scattering properties for as much time as it takes for heat to diffuse away from the area around an emitter. This time scale \(1/\omega_s\) is typically on the order of microseconds for organic materials

where \(\omega_s=2 \kappa C^{-1}R_s^{-2}\) (\(R_s\) is the minimum resolvable distance of the imaging system, and \(\kappa\) and \(C\) are the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of the mounting medium, respectively). For reasonable estimates of the parameters in this relationship (\(\kappa\approx0.2\frac{W}{mK}\) and \(C\approx2\frac{J}{Kcm^3}\)), we predict that a photothermal image of our sample should persist roughly 0.8 &micro;s after the excitation laser has been turned off.
</p>

<p>The 0.5 V/&micro;s unity gain slew rate of the <a href="#buffer_amp" target="_self">buffer amplifier</a> we use to send the appropriate current to our <a href="#AOM" target="_self">acousto-optic modulator</a> drivers  forces us to drive our <a href="#analog_out_card" target="_self">analog out card</a> at a maximum of 0.8 MHz, which  means that 1.25 &micro;s is the shortest attainable duration for our excitation and stimulation laser pulses. In order to make observations with the highest available time resolution, we solely report results in the main article and elsewhere in this appendix using the minimum available excitation and stimulation laser pulse duration. In those images, we did not observe any time-delayed effects of the excitation pulse. As is evident in the time-delayed images in the <a href="#Phase_contrast_image_generation" target="_self">phase contrast image generation</a> and <a href="#Dark-field_image_generation" target="_self">dark-field image generation</a> sections, the changes in the images due to excitation do not appear to persist longer than the 1.25 &micro;s excitation laser pulse duration. While the lack of microsecond-delayed signal is encouraging, we note that because the minimum laser pulse duration is similar to our rough estimation of the duration of a photothermal signal, it is possible that we may not be able to discern some photothermal signals from stimulated emission in our current optical setup.
</p>

<p/>We did manage to observe some apparant sample heating in phase contrast imaging mode of the nanodiamonds (main article Figure 2b with <code>Imaging method: Phase contrast imaging of stimulated emission and scattered light</code> and <code>Fluorescent sample type: Nanodiamonds doped with N-v centers</code> selected) when we increased the duration of the excitation laser pulse by a factor of 20 (25 microseconds) while maintaining the same peak excitation intensity. When we delayed the stimulation laser pulse with reference to the longer and more energetic excitation pulse, we observed a change in brightness of the main lobe of the phase contrast image of the nanodiamond that persisted for milliseconds after the end of the excitation pulse (Figure A6, red solid line). We also observed that the total brightness of the coherent background similarly changed, though to a lesser degree (Figure A6, red dashed line). For each exposure, we used one 25 &micro;s excitation laser pulse and one 5 &micro;s stimulation laser pulse with fixed relative pulse delay. At each pulse delay, we took 50 exposures. The stimulation pulse delays ranged from 0 to over 5 milliseconds of time after the excitation pulse. Each data point in Figure A6 represents a change in image brightness from at a single delay averaged over 50 exposures.

<p>Unlike the signal we attribute to stimulated emission that appears in the data in the main article, the phase contrast image signal peaks 250 &micro;s after the end of the excitation pulse and decays with a ~ 1.7 ms time constant. The signal contrast is maximized when the scattered light signal contrast is minimized, meaning that the apparent phase difference between light scattered by the nanodiamond and the time-delayed change in scattered light is 90&deg; &plusmn; 10&deg;. According to the heat diffusion equation we cited earlier in this section, we would expect microsecond and not millisecond duration cooling from a sub-diffraction-sized particle embedded in immersion oil. The long cooling timescale and the fact that the background brightness of the phase contrast image also changed suggest that the excitation laser may have been heating a larger area of the sample&mdash;perhaps the entire field of view. And because the nanodiamond is mechanically coupled to the rest of the sample, the source of the delayed phase contrast signal is not obviously a result of simple long-pulse excitation, heating, and cooling of the nanodiamond. This result further encouraged us to avoid the long pulsed excitation regime in our search for stimulated emission images.

<h3>The image signal depends on the intensity of the excitation and stimulation laser pulses</h3></a>

<p>In the main article, we observed that the change in the brightness of the dark-field scattered light image of a nanodiamond signal depends on both the excitation and stimulation power. We would expect this of stimulated emission in the regime where neither excitation nor stimulated emission depletion is fully saturated (our fluorescence and stimulated emission depletion experiments confirmed this operating regime). Another way to confirm the dependence of the change in scattered light signal on both excitation and stimulation power is to re-do the experiment with longer laser pulses while keeping the pulse energy constant. We predicted that the magnitude of the change in signal, if due to stimulated emission outside of the saturation regime, would have a nearly quadratic dependence on inverse laser pulse length, and a nearly linear dependence on laser pulse intensity. Figure A7 shows experimental data that verifies this relationship.

<h3>Phase contrast imaging of a nanodiamond doped with N-v centers</h3></a>

<p>Nanodiamonds doped with N-v centers are not an ideal candidate for stimulated emission imaging, because scattered light from the nanodiamonds are an extremely bright, coherent background signal whose phase is not tunable. The dark-field measurements of nanodiamonds in the main text show that the scattered light from the nanodiamonds is three orders of magnitude greater than difference of the image due to excitation. As seen in Figure A9 below, phase contrast imaging of stimulated emission from fluorescent nanodiamonds (<a href="./index.html#Figure_2">Figure 2b</a> in the main article with <code>Imaging method: Phase contrast imaging of stimulated emission and scattered light</code> and <code>Fluorescent sample type: Nanodiamonds doped with N-v centers</code> selected) shows a change in the scattered light phase contrast image of a nanodiamond due to excitation that appears to be a decrease in amount of scattered light. This appears to be an identical result to our dark-field measurements, and shows that the phase contrast technique did not provide further information about stimulated emission from fluorescent nanodiamonds.

<p>In this experiment, we took phase contrast images of our nanodiamond samples with 32 different phase plate angles. The phase plate angle was adjusted in steps of 0.2&deg;, over a total range of 6.2&deg;. The angle of the phase plate maps nonlinearly onto the relative phase angle between transmitted light and scattered light, resulting in an average optical phase shift of ~ 14&deg; for each phase plate step. At each phase plate angle, we took five exposures with different relative delays between excitation and stimulation pulses: \(\Delta\tau\) = -2.5 &micro;s, -1.25 &micro;s, 0 &micro;s, 1.25 &micro;s, and 2.5 &micro;s. We repeated this sequence 1000 times for each phase plate angle. During each exposure, two 1.25 &micro;s duration excitation and stimulation pulse pairs were incident on the camera with 600 &micro;s delay between each pair. In between exposures, a constant stream of 1.25 &micro;s excitation pulses illuminated the camera with 600 &micro;s inter-pulse spacing in order to maintain <a href="#Controls_for_thermal_effects_due_to_the_excitation_laser" target="_self">thermal stability</a> of the sample, though we did not detect any sample heating using these laser exposure parameters.

<p>A phase contrast image of light scattered from a nanodiamond is in the upper panel of Figure A9. This image is an average of the 1000 exposures taken when the stimulation laser pulse preceded the excitation pulse by 2.5 &micro;s at a single phase plate angle. The lower panel of Figure A9 shows a difference images: the difference between the 1000 exposure average of the phase contrast image with simultaneous stimulation and excitation pulses versus the corresponding image in the above panel. By adjusting the phase plate angle (Figure A9 with <code>Phase plate position #: 0-31</code> selected) we note that the maximum negative contrast of the difference image corresponds with the maximum positive contrast image of the scattered light, and vice versa. As with the darkfield measurement, the phase contrast difference image appears to resemble a decrease in the magnitude of scattered light due to coincident excitation and stimulation.

<p>We took the photograph in Figure 2a with a smartphone camera, annotated it with numbers in

<a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/impress/">LibreOffice Impress</a>,

 and then saved the odp file in pdf format (available using <code>File > Export as pdf</code>). Next, we used an online tool to split the pdf into separate pdfs (<a href="https://www.splitpdf.com/">example here</a>). Finally, we converted each pdf to svg format using <a href="https://github.com/dawbarton/pdf2svg">pdf2svg</a> (place in pdf2svg distribution folder and then use command prompt call: <code>pdf2svg</code> <code>*.pdf</code> <code>*.svg</code>). The photograph, Impress presentation and pdf2svg distribution are found in the figure generation folder. <strong>TODO: link to folder</strong>
