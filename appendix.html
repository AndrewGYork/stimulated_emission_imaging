Nanodiamond properties and mounting</h3>

<p>Diamond samples doped with nitrogen-vacancy (N-v) centers absorb green light, emit bright red fluorescence, and do not photobleach

[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.276.5321.2012" title="Gruber, A., A. DrÃ¤benstedt, C. Tietz, L. Fleury, J. Wrachtrup, and C. Von Borczyskowski. &quot;Scanning confocal optical microscopy and magnetic resonance on single defect centers.&quot; Science 276, no. 5321 (1997): 2012-2014.">Gruber 1997</a>].

Figure A1 is a sample transmission electron microscope image (TEM) of nanodiamonds like the ones we imaged. The TEM image and cover glasses with mounted nanodiamonds were a kind gift from Keir Neuman (National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD). The nanodiamonds have an average diameter of ~ 80 nm, but vary widely in shape and size. The nanodiamonds were spun down for 1 minute at 10,000 rpm in a benchtop centrifuge to remove large aggregates. The supernatant was collected and mixed in 1:10 proportion with poly-lysine

(<a href="http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/biofiles/poly-lysine.html">Sigma-Aldrich</a>).

20 &micro;l of the mixture was then deposited on a cover glass rotating at 12,000 rpm in a spin coater

(<a href="http://www.laurell.com/">Laurell Technologies</a>).

Prior to imaging in our microscope, we put a drop of immersion oil (Nikon Type A, n = 1.515) on the nanodiamond side of the cover and sandwiched it between the cover glass and a 1 mm thick BK7 or fused silica glass window.

Crimson dyed polystyrene bead properties and mounting</h3>

<p>The 200 nm diameter crimson dyed polystyrene beads were bought in solution

(<a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/F8806">ThermoFisher</a>, 2% solids).

To prepare the beads, we first cleaned a cover glass with de-ionized water and then applied a 200 &micro;l drop of poly-L-lysine solution

(<a href="http://www.emsdiasum.com/microscopy/technical/datasheet/19320.aspx">Electron Microscopy Sciences</a>)

to the center. After ten minutes, we removed as much of the poly-L-lysine as possible with a pipette, leaving an invisibly thin layer. We then further diluted the bead solution by 3 parts in 10<sup>6</sup> with de-ionized water and added 100 &micro;l of the diluted bead solution to the center of the cover glass. We allowed the solution to remain on the cover glass for 20 minutes and then removed it with the pipette. We made a 1:1 mixture of n = 1.582 and n = 1.605 Meltmount mounting media 

(<a href="http://www.cargille.com/meltmount.shtml">Cargille Labs</a>)

in a glass beaker on a hot plate and dropped it onto a 1 mm thick BK7 or fused silica glass window. We then carefully pressed the cover glass, bead side down, onto the glass window and allowed it to cool before imaging.

<h3 id="Controls_for_thermal_effects_due_to_the_excitation_laser">
Controls for thermal effects due to the excitation laser</h3>

<p>In order to confirm that the change we observe in the scattered 721 nm wavelength (red) light images are due to coherent interference with stimulated emission, we had to rule out other possible effects of the excitation (green) laser pulse on the red image (comprised of the transmitted stimulating beam, scattered light, and stimulated emission). Stimulated emission is a fast process; it may emit from a fluorophore as long as it is in the excited state, which normally persists just nanoseconds after the excitation energy is shut off. The excitation laser pulse could also possibly heat the emitters, which could change the size or refractive index of the emitter with respect to the surrounding media. This, in turn, would change the scattering properties of the emitter and alter the scattered light image. However, heating is a process that should persist long after the excitation laser is turned off.
</p>

<p>In our experiments, we irradiated fluorescent samples with 1 &micro;s duration excitation and stimulation laser pulses. Figure A5 shows a sample dark-field image of a N-v center-doped nanodiamond when irradiated solely by the stimulation laser pulses, along with the change in the image due to excitation laser pulses with variable delay relative to the stimulation pulses. When the excitation and stimulation pulses were simultaneous, we observed maximal decrease in brightness of the dark field scattered light image. When the stimulation pulse irradiated the sample just microseconds after the excitation pulse, we observed no change in brightness. From this, we conclude that the change in brightness occurs on a timescale faster than ~ 1 &micro;s, as we would expect from stimulated emission.
</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure A5: The change in dark-field nanodiamond image has a sub-microsecond response time.</strong> Scanning the delay between the excitation (green) and stimulation (red) laser pulses shows the observed change in the scattered red light signal has a timescale at least as short as the laser pulse duration (~ 1 &micro;s).</figcaption>
</figure><p></p>

<p>In phase contrast imaging mode of the nanodiamonds, we increased the duration of the excitation laser pulse by a factor of 20 (25 microseconds) while maintaining the same peak excitation intensity. We delayed the stimulation laser pulse  with reference to the excitation pulse and observed a change in phase contrast signal formed by the stimulation pulse that persisted after the end of the excitation pulse. This result can be seen in Figure A6. Unlike the signal we attribute to stimulated emission that appears in the data in the main article, this signal peaks 250 &micro;s after the end of the excitation pulse and decays with a ~ 1 ms time constant. Additionally, the delayed signal contrast is maximized when the scattered light signal contrast is minimized, meaning that the phase difference between scattered light and the time-delayed change in scattered light is 90&deg; &plusmn; 10&deg;. This result reinforces our conclusion that the sub-microsecond timescale effect we described in the main article is not heating [why?].

<h3 id="The_image_signal_depends_on_the_intensity_of_the_excitation_and_stimulation_laser_pulses">
The image signal depends on the intensity of the excitation and stimulation laser pulses</h3>

<p>In the main article, we observed that the change in the brightness of the dark-field scattered light image of a nanodiamond signal depends on both the excitation and stimulation power. We would expect this of stimulated emission in the regime where neither excitation nor stimulated emission depletion is fully saturated (our fluorescence and stimulated emission depletion experiments confirmed this operating regime). Another way to confirm the dependence of the change in scattered light signal on both excitation and stimulation power is to re-do the experiment with longer laser pulses while keeping the pulse energy constant. We predicted that the magnitude of the change in signal, if due to stimulated emission, would have a quadratic dependence on inverse laser pulse length, and a linear dependence on laser pulse intensity. Figure A7 shows experimental data that verifies this relationship.

<p>We performed a similar excitation and stimulation laser pulse length scan when attempting to image stimulated emission from index-matched crimson dyed polystyrene beads using phase contrast microscopy. Figure A8 shows the same linear dependence of the magnitude of the phase contrast signal on laser pulse intensity. We expected this behavior, since our fluorescence and stimulated emission depletion measurements of the crimson dyed beads demonstrated that neither excitation nor stimulated emission were fully saturated.

<h3 id="Phase_contrast_imaging_of_a_nanodiamond_doped_with_N-v_centers">
Phase contrast imaging of a nanodiamond doped with N-v centers</h3>

<p>In the main article, we note that nanodiamonds doped with N-v centers are not an ideal candidate for stimulated emission imaging. The dark-field measurements show that the scattered light from the nanodiamonds is three orders of magnitude greater than perturbation of the image (presumably due to stimulated emission). As seen in Figure A9 below, phase contrast imaging of the nanodiamonds shows that the scattered light signal still dominates the perturbation signal in similar proportion. Figure A9 also shows scattered light images of the nanodiamonds with the corresponding change due to excitation for different angular positions of the phase plate, which served to delay the transmitted light with reference to the scattered light. The phase plate angle was adjusted in steps of 0.2&deg;, over a total range of 6.2&deg;. The angle of the phase plate maps nonlinearly onto the relative phase angle between transmitted light and scattered light, resulting in an average optical phase shift of ~ 14&deg; for each phase plate step. The images below confirm that the change in signal due to excitation resembles a decrease in the magnitude of scattered light.
