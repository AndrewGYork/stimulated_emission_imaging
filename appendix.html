Nanodiamond properties and mounting</h3>

<p>Diamond samples doped with nitrogen-vacancy (N-v) centers absorb green light, emit bright red fluorescence, and do not photobleach

[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.276.5321.2012" title="Gruber, A., A. Dräbenstedt, C. Tietz, L. Fleury, J. Wrachtrup, and C. Von Borczyskowski. &quot;Scanning confocal optical microscopy and magnetic resonance on single defect centers.&quot; Science 276, no. 5321 (1997): 2012-2014.">Gruber 1997</a>].

Figure A1 is a sample transmission electron microscope image (TEM) of nanodiamonds like the ones we imaged. The TEM image and cover glasses with mounted nanodiamonds were a kind gift from Keir Neuman (National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD). The nanodiamonds have an average diameter of ~ 80 nm, but vary widely in shape and size. The nanodiamonds were spun down for 1 minute at 10,000 rpm in a benchtop centrifuge to remove large aggregates. The supernatant was collected and mixed in 1:10 proportion with poly-lysine

(<a href="http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/biofiles/poly-lysine.html">Sigma-Aldrich</a>).

20 &micro;l of the mixture was then deposited on a cover glass rotating at 12,000 rpm in a spin coater

(<a href="http://www.laurell.com/">Laurell Technologies</a>).

We put a drop of immersion oil (Nikon Type A, n = 1.515) on the nanodiamond side of the cover and sandwiched it between the cover glass and a 1 mm thick BK7 or fused silica glass window. The circular sample is then put into the <a href="./appendix.html#Sample_holder">sample holder</a> and imaged.

<h3 id="Crimson_dyed_polystyrene_bead_properties_and_mounting">
Crimson dyed polystyrene bead properties and mounting</h3>
<strong>TODO: include orange beads now</strong>
<p>The 200 nm diameter crimson dyed polystyrene beads were bought in solution

(<a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/F8806">ThermoFisher</a>, 2% solids).

To prepare the beads, we first cleaned a 1" diameter cover glass with de-ionized water and then applied a 200 &micro;L drop of poly-L-lysine solution

(<a href="http://www.emsdiasum.com/microscopy/technical/datasheet/19320.aspx">Electron Microscopy Sciences</a>)

to the center. After ten minutes, we removed as much of the poly-L-lysine as possible with a pipette, leaving an invisibly thin layer. We then washed off excess poly-L-lysine by applying 200 &micro;L de-ionized water to the center of the cover glass and immediately removing it. We then further diluted the bead solution by 3 parts in 10<sup>6</sup> with de-ionized water and added 100 &micro;L of the diluted bead solution to the center of the cover glass. We allowed the solution to remain on the cover glass for 20 minutes and then removed it with the pipette.
</p>

<p>We prepared the beads (polystyrene refractive index n ~ 1.6) in mounting media with three distinct refractive indices. The idea (as explained in the main article) is to use positive, zero, and negative refractive index to estimate the relative phase between transmitted, scattered, and stimulated light. We used commercially available mounting media with refractive index <a href="./appendix.html#meltmount_1539">1.539</a>, <a href="./appendix.html#meltmount_1582">1.582</a> and <a href="./appendix.html#meltmount_1605">1.605</a>. For index-matched beads, we made a 1:1 mixture of the n = 1.582 and n = 1.605 mounting media in a glass beaker on a hot plate and dropped it onto a 1 mm thick, 1" diameter BK7 or fused silica glass window. We then carefully pressed the cover glass (bead side down) onto the glass window and allowed it to cool. The circular sample is then put into the <a href="./appendix.html#Sample_holder">sample holder</a> and imaged. The 1:1 ratio made the beads least visible in our phase contrast microscope. We therefore estimated the refractive index of the beads to be ~ 1.594. We additionally mounted the beads in only n = 1.539 media (&Delta;n ~ 0.05) and n = 1.605 media (&Delta;n ~ -0.01).

<h3 id="FLIM">
Fluorescence lifetime measurements</h3>
<p>We measure fluorescence lifetime of the crimson and orange dyed polystyrene beads, as well as the N-v center doped nanodiamonds, using the fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) module of a <a href="https://www.leica-microsystems.com/products/confocal-microscopes/details/product/leica-tcs-sp8/">Leica SP8 confocal microscope</a>. Excitation wavelengths were 561 nm (orange beads and nanodiamonds) and 594 nm (crimson beads), as opposed to 532 nm; these were chosen because they matched the dichroic filters of the camera that better shield the FLIM module from excitation light. The lifetime curves of the crimson and orange beads were well-fit by a single exponential function, yielding lifetimes of 2.89 &plusmn; 0.05 ns (crimson beads) and 3.85 &plusmn; 0.03 ns (orange beads). The N-v doped nanodiamonds yielded lifetime curves that could not be fit by a single exponential because of a small fast-decaying signal, but a two-exponential fit yielded a primary lifetime of 12.41 &plusmn; 0.13 ns, and a secondary lifetime of 1.135 &plusmn; 0.041 ns. The ~12 ns lifetime seemingly agrees with measurements of the excited state lifetime of N-v centers in bulk diamond

[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2013.02.001" title="Doherty, Marcus W., Neil B. Manson, Paul Delaney, Fedor Jelezko, Jörg Wrachtrup, and Lloyd CL Hollenberg. &quot;The nitrogen-vacancy colour centre in diamond.&quot; Physics Reports 528, no. 1 (2013): 1-45.">Doherty 2013</a>],

though single N-v centers in nanodiamonds with diameter less than the wavelength of fluorescent emission has been measured to be 25 ns, with the discrepancy attributed to the large difference in refractive index between the nanodiamond and its surroundings

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.64.061802" title="Beveratos, Alexios, Rosa Brouri, Thierry Gacoin, Jean-Philippe Poizat, and Philippe Grangier. &quot;Nonclassical radiation from diamond nanocrystals.&quot; Physical Review A 64, no. 6 (2001): 061802.">Beveratos 2001</a>].

<strong>TODO: It isn't clear to me why our measurements agree with bulk measurements.</strong>
</p>

<h3 id="Sample_holder">
Sample holder</h3>

<p>Imaging stimulated emission via our experimental setup involves using our camera to resolve signals of ~10-100 pixel counts on top of a background of ~20,000-50,000 pixel counts. Because the laser power fluctuations can exceed the signal level, averaging of images is important to be able to observe the signal. Vibration of the sample makes averaging separate images impossible. In order to combat vibration, we attempted to mount our samples as stably as possible. We secured our 1" diameter circular samples in a <a href="./appendix.html#lens_mount">lens mount</a> and anchored it to a 3D stage comprised of a <a href="./appendix.html#vertical_stage">manual vertical stage</a>, a <a href="./appendix.html#horizontal_stage">manual horizontal stage</a>, and an <a href="./appendix.html#axial_stage">axial stage</a> fitted with a <a href="./appendix.html#piezo_actuator">piezoelectric actuator</a> to take automated axial stacks of the sample.
</p>

<p>The entire microscope is screwed onto a <a href="./appendix.html#optical_table">floating optical table</a> for vibrational isolation from the floor. The 532 nm laser has an on-board fan that caused vibration of the sample through the optical table. In order to solve this problem, we detached the fan from the back of the laser head and anchored it to a nearby wall not in contact with the optical table. We connected the back of the laser head to the fan with a thin polyethylene bellows, which allowed the fan to continue to pull air from the laser.

<h3 id="Phase_contrast_image_generation">
Phase contrast image generation</h3>

<p>We illuminate optically excited fluorescent dyed beads and nanodiamonds with a train of several green (532 nm) laser pulses to excite the samples, and also several pulses of red (721 nm) light in order to stimulate emission from them. When we image the red light, we use part of the stimulation beam as a coherent background in order to generate a phase contrast image of the stimulated emission. The red pulses are 1.25 &micro;s in duration and are separated by 600 &micro;s. The green pulses are also 1.25 &micro;s in duration and are separated by 600 &micro;s. Because it is not clear which phase plate angle will provide the best relative background phase shift to detect the emission from the sample, we take phase contrast images of the sample for a variety of phase plate angles. For each phase plate angle, a typical measurement (<strong>TODO link to data taking program and folder?</strong>)is comprised of three sequential camera exposures:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>During the first exposure, the red pulse train precedes the green pulse train by 2.5 &micro;s. Because 600 &micro;s is much longer than the excitation lifetime, there should be no stimulated emission.</li>
  <li>During the second exposure, the red and green pulses are simultaneous. Stimulated emission should be possible.</li>
  <li>During the third exposure, the green pulse train precedes the red pulse train by 2.5 &micro;s. Because 2.5 &micro;s is much longer than the excitation lifetime, there should be no stimulated emission. If the green pulse modifies the sample in a time-delayed fashion (e.g. heating) and this effect persists longer than 2.5 &micro;s, there may be some effect on the phase contrast image.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>The difference between the first and second exposure should let us know the effect of excitation on the phase contrast image of the beam; we hope this effect is due to stimulated emission. However, simply subtracting one image from the other is not sufficient; the red laser intensity fluctuates between those two exposures. In our image extraction code (<strong>TODO link to figure generation code?</strong>) we re-scale the two images prior to subtraction in this manner:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>We estimate the average brightness of the red laser by averaging all phase contrast images and then finding the mean pixel value of the regions of the image that do not contain the sample particle (the background).</li>
  <li>We estimate the brightness of the red laser in each exposure by finding the mean pixel value of the background of each exposure.</li>
  <li>We re-scale each individual exposure by a factor of the ratio of the average background to its own background.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>After re-scaling all of the phase contrast images, we then subtract the first exposure from the second exposure, resulting in a "difference image" that encapsulates the effect of excitation on the phase contrast image. Our pixels our tiny (8.7 nm/pixel) to give large dynamic range. This is not great for viewing, because fluctuations can swamp the signal. Prior to display of the difference images, we bin 8 x 8 regions of pixels to give a more typical size (69.6 nm/pixel).
</p>
<p>While the above processing is all that is involved in generating the stimulated emission "difference images," making simple phase contrast images of the polystyrene beads requires a few more steps. This is because there is a large background variation in the simple phase contrast images due to multiple reflections in the microscope. Some of it appears to move only when the phase plate moves ( the "stationary component"), and some of it moves regardless of whether the phase plate has changed (the "non-stationary component"). The "difference images" for each phase plate angle automatically ignore this variation as long as we perform brightness correction. However, the beads are either fairly or extremely well index-matched to their mounting media, and are nearly or completely invisible atop these background variations.
</p>
<p>To remove the stationary component from each phase contrast image of the bead, we subtract another phase contrast image at a nearby phase plate angle at which the scattered light contrast would be minimal (least amount of constructive or destructive interference).
</p>
<p>We find that the non-stationary component of the background noise in the phase contrast images is comprised of stripes that are completely outside of the microscope's spatial pass-band. We perform a gaussian filter on the phase contrast images to attenuate this striping artifiact with almost no effect on the spatial frequencies due to the sample.
</p>
<p>After minimizing the stationary and non-stationary noise in the phase contrast images, we bin the pixels in the same matter as we did for the difference images. By performing these additional steps, we find it possible to image nearly perfectly index-matched beads.
</p>

Fitting to the photobleaching curve</h3>
<p><strong>TODO: Write this section. (1) Many fluorophores, including GFP, do not have a single bleaching rate. Ours are clearly one of these. (2) We were able to get a good fit of the fluorescence bleaching data with a 4-exponential fit, for beads that were only excited, and for beads that were excited and depleted. (3) Our complicated depletion rate is a function of our weird fluorophore, and not of stimulated emission depletion. (4) They co-decrease, but in order to tell if one truly affects the other, we need a dual-camera setup.</strong>

<p>The fluorescence plot in Figure 3 in the online version of the <a href="./index.html" title="Main text" target="_self">main article</a> shows a transverse (xy) view of the fluorescence from a nanodiamond doped with N-v centers at focus. Figure A4 below shows an axial (xz) projection of a stack of fluorescence images taken with varying axial position of the nanodiamond relative to focus. The images used to generate the axial projection were taken in 200 nm axial steps.

<h3 id="Controls_for_thermal_effects_due_to_the_excitation_laser">
Controls for thermal effects due to the excitation laser</h3>

<p>In order to confirm that the change we observe in the scattered 721 nm wavelength (red) light images are due to coherent interference with stimulated emission, we had to rule out other possible effects of the excitation (green) laser pulse on the red image (comprised of the transmitted stimulating beam, scattered light, and stimulated emission). Stimulated emission is a fast process; it may emit from a fluorophore as long as it is in the excited state, which normally persists just nanoseconds after the excitation energy is shut off. The excitation laser pulse could also possibly heat the emitters, which could change the size or refractive index of the emitter with respect to the surrounding media. This, in turn, would change the scattering properties of the emitter and alter the scattered light image. However, heating is a process that should persist long after the excitation laser is turned off.
</p>

<p>In our experiments, we irradiated fluorescent samples with 1 &micro;s duration excitation and stimulation laser pulses. Figure A5 shows a sample dark-field image of a N-v center-doped nanodiamond when irradiated solely by the stimulation laser pulses, along with the change in the image due to excitation laser pulses with variable delay relative to the stimulation pulses. When the excitation and stimulation pulses were simultaneous, we observed maximal decrease in brightness of the dark field scattered light image. When the stimulation pulse irradiated the sample just microseconds after the excitation pulse, we observed no change in brightness. From this, we conclude that the change in brightness occurs on a timescale faster than ~ 1 &micro;s, as we would expect from stimulated emission.

<p>In phase contrast imaging mode of the nanodiamonds, we increased the duration of the excitation laser pulse by a factor of 20 (25 microseconds) while maintaining the same peak excitation intensity. We delayed the stimulation laser pulse  with reference to the excitation pulse and observed a change in phase contrast signal formed by the stimulation pulse that persisted after the end of the excitation pulse. This result can be seen in Figure A6. Unlike the signal we attribute to stimulated emission that appears in the data in the main article, this signal peaks 250 &micro;s after the end of the excitation pulse and decays with a ~ 1.7 ms time constant. Additionally, the delayed signal contrast is maximized when the scattered light signal contrast is minimized, meaning that the phase difference between scattered light and the time-delayed change in scattered light is 90&deg; &plusmn; 10&deg;. This result reinforces our conclusion that the sub-microsecond timescale effect we described in the main article is not heating [why?].

The image signal depends on the intensity of the excitation and stimulation laser pulses</h3>

<p>In the main article, we observed that the change in the brightness of the dark-field scattered light image of a nanodiamond signal depends on both the excitation and stimulation power. We would expect this of stimulated emission in the regime where neither excitation nor stimulated emission depletion is fully saturated (our fluorescence and stimulated emission depletion experiments confirmed this operating regime). Another way to confirm the dependence of the change in scattered light signal on both excitation and stimulation power is to re-do the experiment with longer laser pulses while keeping the pulse energy constant. We predicted that the magnitude of the change in signal, if due to stimulated emission, would have a quadratic dependence on inverse laser pulse length, and a linear dependence on laser pulse intensity. Figure A7 shows experimental data that verifies this relationship.

<p>We performed a similar excitation and stimulation laser pulse length scan when attempting to image stimulated emission from index-matched crimson dyed polystyrene beads using phase contrast microscopy. Figure A8 shows the same linear dependence of the magnitude of the phase contrast signal on laser pulse intensity. We expected this behavior, since our fluorescence and stimulated emission depletion measurements of the crimson dyed beads demonstrated that neither excitation nor stimulated emission were fully saturated.

Phase contrast imaging of a nanodiamond doped with N-v centers</h3>

<p>In the main article, we note that nanodiamonds doped with N-v centers are not an ideal candidate for stimulated emission imaging. The dark-field measurements show that the scattered light from the nanodiamonds is three orders of magnitude greater than perturbation of the image (presumably due to stimulated emission). As seen in Figure A9 below, phase contrast imaging of the nanodiamonds shows that the scattered light signal still dominates the perturbation signal in similar proportion. Figure A9 also shows scattered light images of the nanodiamonds with the corresponding change due to excitation for different angular positions of the phase plate, which served to delay the transmitted light with reference to the scattered light. The phase plate angle was adjusted in steps of 0.2&deg;, over a total range of 6.2&deg;. The angle of the phase plate maps nonlinearly onto the relative phase angle between transmitted light and scattered light, resulting in an average optical phase shift of ~ 14&deg; for each phase plate step. The images below confirm that the change in signal due to excitation resembles a decrease in the magnitude of scattered light.
