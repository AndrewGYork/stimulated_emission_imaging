<h3>Rate constants for fluorophores</h3></a>

<p>In

[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OL.19.000780" title="Hell, Stefan W., and Jan Wichmann. &quot;Breaking the diffraction resolution limit by stimulated emission: stimulated-emission-depletion fluorescence microscopy.&quot; Optics letters 19, no. 11 (1994): 780-782.">Hell 1994</a>],

the spontaneous emission rate constant of the excited state of a fluorophore is \(1/\tau_{fluor}\), and \(Q\) is the nonradiative quenching rate of the excited state. The combined rate constant \(1/\tau_{exc}=1/\tau_{fluor}+Q\) is the inverse of the excited state lifetime, which is commonly called the fluorescence lifetime <a href="#FLIM" target="_self">when it is measured</a>. The quantum yield \(\Phi\) is the ratio between the spontaneous emission rate constant and the total excited state decay rate constant: \(\Phi=\tau_{exc}/\tau_{fluor}\).
</p>

<p>In the introduction to the main article, we cite GFP and Alexa Fluor 488 dye as examples to highlight the difference between the magnitude of the spontaneous emission rate constant \(1/\tau_{fluor}\) and the intensity-dependent stimulated emission rate constant. The reference for those rates only specifies the more easily measured \(\tau_{exc}\) (3.2 ns for GFP and 4.0 ns for Alexa 488)

[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/cr900343z" title="Berezin, Mikhail Y., and Samuel Achilefu. &quot;Fluorescence lifetime measurements and biological imaging.&quot; Chemical reviews 110, no. 5 (2010): 2641-2684.">Berezin 2010</a>].

We compute \(\tau_{fluor}\) by first looking up \(\Phi\) for both fluorophores (0.79 for GFP

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3495(97)78307-3" title="Patterson, George H., Susan M. Knobel, Wallace D. Sharif, Steven R. Kain, and David W. Piston. &quot:Use of the green fluorescent protein and its mutants in quantitative fluorescence microscopy.&quot; Biophysical journal 73, no. 5 (1997): 2782-2790.">Patterson 1997</a>]

and 0.92 for Alexa 488

[<a class="citation" href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/molecular-probes-the-handbook.html" title="Johnson, Iain D. &quot;Molecular Probes Handbook: A Guide to Fluorescent Probes and Labeling Technologies.&quot; Life Technologies Coroporation, 2010">Johnson 2010</a>])

and then using the measured \(\tau_{exc}\) as well as the relationship in the previous paragraph to arrive at \(\tau_{fluor}\) of 4.1 ns for GFP and 4.3 for Alexa 488.

<h3>Nanodiamond properties and mounting</h3></a>

<p>Diamond samples doped with nitrogen-vacancy (N-v) centers absorb green light, emit bright red fluorescence, and do not photobleach

[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.276.5321.2012" title="Gruber, A., A. Dräbenstedt, C. Tietz, L. Fleury, J. Wrachtrup, and C. Von Borczyskowski. &quot;Scanning confocal optical microscopy and magnetic resonance on single defect centers.&quot; Science 276, no. 5321 (1997): 2012-2014.">Gruber 1997</a>].

Figure A1 is a sample transmission electron microscope image (TEM) of nanodiamonds like the ones we imaged. The TEM image and cover glasses with mounted nanodiamonds were a kind gift from Keir Neuman (National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD). The nanodiamonds have an average diameter of ~ 80 nm, but vary widely in shape and size. The nanodiamonds were spun down for 1 minute at 10,000 rpm in a benchtop centrifuge to remove large aggregates. The supernatant was collected and mixed in 1:10 proportion with poly-lysine

(<a href="http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/biofiles/poly-lysine.html">Sigma-Aldrich</a>).

20 &micro;l of the mixture was then deposited on a cover glass rotating at 12,000 rpm in a spin coater

(<a href="http://www.laurell.com/">Laurell Technologies</a>).

We put a drop of immersion oil (Nikon Type A, n = 1.515) on the nanodiamond side of the cover and sandwiched it between the cover glass and a 1 mm thick BK7 or fused silica glass window. The circular sample is then put into the <a href="#Sample_holder" target="_self">sample holder</a> and imaged.

<a id="Fluorescent_polystyrene_bead_properties_and_mounting" href="#Fluorescent_polystyrene_bead_properties_and_mounting" target="_self">
<h3>Fluorescent polystyrene bead properties and mounting</h3></a>

<p>We bought the 200 nm diameter <a href="#crimson_beads" target="_self">crimson</a> and <a href="#orange_beads" target="_self">orange</a> fluorescent dyed polystyrene beads in a 2% solid solution. We display excitation and emission spectra in <a href="./index.html#Figure_2">Figure 2b</a> in the main article with <code>Fluorescent sample type: Beads...</code> selected. In later sections of this appendix, we show how we measured the <a href="#FLIM" target="_self">fluorescence lifetime</a> and the <a href="#Delivering_the_same_heat_load_to_the_orange_beads" target="_self">quantum yield</a> of the beads.
</p>

<p>To prepare the beads, we first cleaned a 1" diameter cover glass with de-ionized water and then applied a 200 &micro;L drop of poly-L-lysine solution

(<a href="http://www.emsdiasum.com/microscopy/technical/datasheet/19320.aspx">Electron Microscopy Sciences</a>)

to the center. After ten minutes, we removed as much of the poly-L-lysine as possible with a pipette, leaving an invisibly thin layer. We then washed off excess poly-L-lysine by applying 200 &micro;L de-ionized water to the center of the cover glass and immediately removing it. We then further diluted the bead solution by 3 parts in 10<sup>6</sup> with de-ionized water and added 100 &micro;L of the diluted bead solution to the center of the cover glass. We allowed the solution to remain on the cover glass for 20 minutes and then removed it with the pipette.
</p>

<p>We prepared the beads (polystyrene refractive index n ~ 1.6) in mounting media with three distinct refractive indices greater than, equal to, and less than 1.6 (As explained in the main article, we used these media in order to estimate the relative phase between transmitted, scattered, and stimulated light). We used commercially available mounting media with refractive index <a href="#meltmount_1539" target="_self">1.539</a>, <a href="#meltmount_1582" target="_self">1.582</a> and <a href="#meltmount_1605" target="_self">1.605</a>. For index-matched beads, we made a 1:1 mixture of the n = 1.582 and n = 1.605 mounting media in a glass beaker on a hot plate and dropped it onto a 1 mm thick, 1" diameter BK7 or fused silica glass window. We then carefully pressed the cover glass (bead side down) onto the glass window and allowed it to cool. The circular sample is then put into the <a href="#Sample_holder" target="_self">sample holder</a> and imaged. The 1:1 ratio made the beads least visible in our phase contrast microscope. We therefore estimated the refractive index of the beads to be ~ 1.594. We additionally mounted the beads in only n = 1.539 media (&Delta;n ~ 0.05) and n = 1.605 media (&Delta;n ~ -0.01).
</p>

<a id="FLIM" href="#FLIM" target="_self">
<h3>Fluorescence lifetime measurements</h3></a>
<p>We measure the <a href="#Rate_constants_for_fluorophores" target="_self">excited state lifetime (\(\tau_{exc}\))</a> of the crimson and orange dyed polystyrene beads, as well as the N-v center doped nanodiamonds, using the fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) module of a <a href="https://www.leica-microsystems.com/products/confocal-microscopes/details/product/leica-tcs-sp8/">Leica SP8 confocal microscope</a>. Excitation wavelengths were 561 nm (orange beads and nanodiamonds) and 594 nm (crimson beads), as opposed to 532 nm; these were chosen because they matched the emmision filters that better shield the FLIM module from excitation light. The lifetime curves of the crimson and orange beads were well-fit by a single exponential function, yielding lifetimes of 2.89 &plusmn; 0.05 ns (crimson beads) and 3.85 &plusmn; 0.03 ns (orange beads). The N-v doped nanodiamonds yielded lifetime curves that could not be fit by a single exponential because of a small fast-decaying signal, but a two-exponential fit yielded a primary lifetime of 12.41 &plusmn; 0.13 ns, and a secondary lifetime of 1.135 &plusmn; 0.041 ns. The ~12 ns lifetime seemingly agrees with measurements of the excited state lifetime of N-v centers in bulk diamond

[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2013.02.001" title="Doherty, Marcus W., Neil B. Manson, Paul Delaney, Fedor Jelezko, Jörg Wrachtrup, and Lloyd CL Hollenberg. &quot;The nitrogen-vacancy colour centre in diamond.&quot; Physics Reports 528, no. 1 (2013): 1-45.">Doherty 2013</a>],

though single N-v centers in nanodiamonds with diameter less than the wavelength of fluorescent emission has been measured to be 25 ns, with the discrepancy attributed to the large difference in refractive index between the nanodiamond and its surroundings

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.64.061802" title="Beveratos, Alexios, Rosa Brouri, Thierry Gacoin, Jean-Philippe Poizat, and Philippe Grangier. &quot;Nonclassical radiation from diamond nanocrystals.&quot; Physical Review A 64, no. 6 (2001): 061802.">Beveratos 2001</a>].

<strong>TODO: It isn't clear to me why our measurements agree with bulk measurements.</strong>

<h3>Sample holder and vibration isolation</h3></a>

<p>Imaging stimulated emission via our experimental setup involves using our camera to resolve signals of ~10-100 pixel counts on top of a background of ~20,000-50,000 pixel counts. Because the laser power fluctuations can exceed the signal level, averaging of images is important to be able to observe the signal. However, vibration of the sample makes averaging separate images difficult. In order to combat vibration, we attempted to mount our samples as stably as possible. We secured our 1" diameter circular samples in a <a href="#lens_mount" target="_self">lens mount</a> and anchored it to a 3D stage comprised of a <a href="#vertical_stage" target="_self">manual vertical stage</a>, a <a href="#horizontal_stage" target="_self">manual horizontal stage</a>, and an <a href="#axial_stage" target="_self">axial stage</a> fitted with a <a href="#piezo_actuator" target="_self">piezoelectric actuator</a> to take automated axial stacks of the sample.
</p>

<p>The entire microscope is screwed onto a <a href="#optical_table" target="_self">floating optical table</a> for vibrational isolation from the floor. The 532 nm laser has an on-board fan that caused vibration of the sample through the optical table. In order to solve this problem, we detached the fan from the back of the laser head and anchored it to a nearby wall not in contact with the optical table. We connected the back of the laser head to the fan with a thin polyethylene bellows, which allowed the fan to continue to pull air from the laser.

<h3>Image acquisition and figure generation</h3></a>

<p>For every experiment we do that contributes to a figure, we store a copy of the python code used to control and synchronize our instruments, along with code dependencies, in the (<strong>TODO: link to data acquisition folder</strong>) folder. These files generated many raw camera images, which we have made available in a dedicated repository (<strong>TODO: link to Zenodo when it's ready</strong>). In some cases, the repository will also store exposure-averaged images (in order to decrease run-time of our figure generation code).
</p>

<p>Each figure that contains experimental data is generated by one or more python scripts (<strong>TODO link to figure generation folder</strong>). These scripts refer to the appropriate images from the data repository (<strong>TODO: link to zenodo</strong>), process the images appropriately (example: <a href="#Phase_contrast_image_generation" target="_self">phase contrast image generation</a>), generate figures, and then store those figures in svg or png format in the figures directory (<strong>TODO link to figures folder</strong>).

<h4>Phase contrast image acqusition details</h4></a>
<p>We illuminate fluorescent samples comprised of dyed beads or nanodiamonds with a train of several green excitation (532 nm) laser pulses as well as several pulses of red (721 nm) light in order to stimulate emission from the samples, and we use part of the stimulation beam as a coherent background in order to generate a phase contrast image of the stimulated emission (see <a href="./index.html#Figure_2">Figure 2b</a> in the main article with <code>Imaging method: Phase contrast imaging of stimulated emission and scattered light</code> selected). The red pulses are 1.25 &micro;s in duration and are separated by 600 &micro;s. The green pulses are also 1.25 &micro;s in duration and are separated by 600 &micro;s. Because it is not clear which phase plate angle will provide the best relative background phase shift to detect the emission from the sample, we take phase contrast images of the sample for a variety of phase plate angles. For each phase plate angle, a typical measurement (<strong>TODO link to data taking program and folder?</strong>)is comprised of three sequential camera exposures:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>During the first exposure, the red pulse train precedes the green pulse train by 2.5 &micro;s. Because 600 &micro;s is much longer than the excitation lifetime, there should be no stimulated emission.</li>
  <li>During the second exposure, the red and green pulses are simultaneous. Stimulated emission should be possible.</li>
  <li>During the third exposure, the green pulse train precedes the red pulse train by 2.5 &micro;s. Because 2.5 &micro;s is much longer than the excitation lifetime, there should be no stimulated emission. If the green pulse modifies the sample in a time-delayed fashion (e.g. heating) and this effect persists longer than 2.5 &micro;s, there may be some effect on the phase contrast image.</li>

<h4>Phase contrast difference image processing</h4></a>

<p>The difference between the first and second exposure (of the three listed above) should let us know the effect of excitation on the phase contrast image of the beam. However, simply subtracting one image from the other is not sufficient; the red laser intensity fluctuates between those two exposures. In our image extraction code (<strong>TODO link to example figure generation code?</strong>) we re-scale the two images prior to subtraction in this manner:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>We estimate the average brightness of the red laser by averaging all phase contrast images and then finding the mean pixel value of the regions of the image that do not contain the sample particle (the background).</li>
  <li>We estimate the brightness of the red laser in each exposure by finding the mean pixel value of the background of each exposure.</li>
  <li>We re-scale each individual exposure by a factor of the ratio of the average background to its own background.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>After re-scaling all of the phase contrast images, we then subtract the first exposure from the second exposure, resulting in a "difference image" that encapsulates the effect of excitation on the phase contrast image. While we use 750x total magnification (8.7 nm/pixel) to give large dynamic range, this is not great for viewing our difference images, because intra-pixel fluctuations can appear to swamp the signal. Prior to display of the difference images, we bin 8 x 8 regions of pixels to give a more typical size (69.6 nm/pixel).
</p>

<p>Figure A5b shows a sample phase contrast image of an index-matched crimson bead prior to excitation, and the change in that image during and after excitation, based upon the experimental method and image processing steps delineated above. The phase plate angle is tuned to maximize contrast of the difference image. For each exposure, we used 8 maximum-intensity excitation/stimulation pulse pairs with 1.25 &micro;s duration and 600 &micro;s between pairs.

<h4>Extra processing for phase contrast imaging of weakly scattered light</h4></a>

<p>While the above processing is all that is involved in generating the stimulated emission "difference images," making simple phase contrast images of scattered light from the polystyrene beads requires a few more steps. This is because there is a large, spatially inhomogeneous background variation in the simple phase contrast images due to multiple reflections in the microscope. Some of the background features appear to vary in location and brightness only when the phase plate moves ( the "stationary component"), and some features vary regardless of whether the phase plate has changed (the "non-stationary component"). The difference images are taken at a single particular phase plate angle, so they are only subject to non-stationary noise. Luckily, the non-stationary background inhomogeneities appear to vary more slowly than the camera exposure rate, so the difference images, which are the difference between adjacent exposures, are not adversely affected (This is akin to in lock-in detection.). On the other hand, because the beads are either fairly or extremely well index-matched to their mounting media, their static scattering is nearly or completely invisible atop the stationary and non-stationary background variations, and we cannot switch scattering on and off quickly enough to elude those variations.
</p>

<p>After performing overall brightness correction on the simple phase contrast bead images, we attempt to remove the stationary component from each bead image with another phase contrast image at a nearby phase plate angle at which the scattered light contrast would be minimal (least amount of constructive or destructive interference). We then note that the remaining stationary and non-stationary and components of the background noise in the phase contrast images are primarily comprised of stripes&mdash;presumably an interference pattern from multiple coherent reflections&mdash;that are completely outside of the microscope's spatial pass-band. We perform a gaussian filter on the phase contrast images to attenuate the high-frequency artifacts with almost no effect on the spatial frequencies due to the sample.
</p>

<p>We finally bin the phase contrast image pixels in the same manner as we did for the difference images. By performing these additional steps, we find it possible to image light scattered from nearly perfectly index-matched beads \((\Delta n\approx -0.01)\), as seen in <a href="./index.html#Figure_3">Figure 3 (top right panel)</a> in the main article.

<h3>Fitting to the photobleaching curve</h3></a>
<p>We performed the experiment in <a href="./index.html#Figure_4">Figure 4</a> of the main text in order to confirm that, like fluorescence, our phase contrast difference images of excited beads faded during prolonged exposure to excitation power. Although we did, indeed, find that the difference images and fluorescence images of both crimson and orange beads faded, we also found it difficult to quantify and compare the bleaching rates. A single exponential function did not fit any of the bleaching curves we acquired. Rather, we were only able to get a good fit of the fluorescence bleaching curves with a 4-exponential fit&mdash;for beads that were only excited, and for beads that were excited and depleted.
</p>

<p>In fact, many fluorophores do not have a single (mono-exponential) bleaching rate, including fluorescent dyes like Rhodamine 6G

Additionally, our use of linearly polarized excitation for fluorophores with random orientation could be another source of multi-exponential fluorescence bleaching. All told, we believe that the complicated bleaching rates we measured are not unusual. The most we can conclude from our measurements is that bead fluorescence and difference images co-decrease; in order to tell if one truly affects the other, we need a dual-camera setup (or at least a fast filter wheel) to monitor fluorescence and difference image decay from the same bead.</p>

<a id="Delivering_the_same_heat_load_to_the_orange_beads" href="#Delivering_the_same_heat_load_to_the_orange_beads" target="_self">
<h3>Delivering the same heat load to the orange beads</h3></a>

<p>Our experimentally generated difference images of excited fluorescent crimson beads in Figures 3 and 4 in the main article are consistent with the model proposed in Figure 1c: that stimulated emission emits spherically from a point source and can by imaged via interference with the stimulating beam. However, these results may also be consistent with a model where the excitation pulse heats the bead and causes its refractive index to change. In order to discern between the two models, we additionaly performed phase contrast imaging of excited orange dyed polystyrene beads, which have a lower stimulated emission cross-section than crimson beads at 721 nm; this allowed us to decrease the expected amount of stimulated emission from a bead while delivering the same thermal energy. We expect that if our difference images are stimulated emission images, the orange bead difference images should be dimmer than the crimson bead images. If our difference images are photothermal images, the difference images of the different beads should have the same brightness.
</p>

<p>In order to deliver the same thermal energy to the orange beads as we did to the crimson beads in earlier experiments through excitation at 532 nm wavelength, we had to carefully account for the fact that orange beads have a different fluorescent efficiency and excitation cross-section than crimson beads.
</p>

<p>We first measured the fluorescent efficiency of the crimson and orange dye (\(\eta_{crimson}\) and \(\eta_{orange}\), respectively) using <a href="#fluorometer" target="_self">fluorometer</a> to measure fluorophore absorption and emission. Measuring absolute fluorescent efficiency is difficult, so we used Rhodamine B as a reference standard. The Rhodamine quantum efficiency \(\Phi=0.49\) in ethanol at room temperature

[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/j100334a023" title="Casey, Kelly G., and Edward L. Quitevis. &quot;Effect of solvent polarity on nonradiative processes in xanthene dyes: Rhodamine B in normal alcohols.&quot; The Journal of Physical Chemistry 92, no. 23 (1988): 6590-6594.">Casey 1988</a>],

and \(\eta=\Phi\frac{\lambda_{excitation}}{\overline{\lambda{fluorescence}}}\), where \(\lambda_{excitation}\) and \(\overline{\lambda_{fluorescence}}\) are the excitation and average emission wavelengths. In this way, we measured \(\eta_{crimson}=0.17\) and \(\eta_{orange}=0.23\) for the beads dissolved in ethanol (we did not have beads dyed with rhodamine). We found that the relative magnitude of crimson and orange absorption and fluorescence measurements of did not vary significantly between dissolved and non-dissolved beads.
</p>

<p>We also fixed a mixture of crimson and orange beads in index-matched media on a microscope slide as <a href="#Fluorescent_polystyrene_bead_properties_and_mounting" target="_self">described earlier</a> and used a <a href="https://www.leica-microsystems.com/products/confocal-microscopes/details/product/leica-tcs-sp8/">Leica SP8 confocal microscope</a> to measure their total fluorescence under non-saturating 532 nm excitation (imaging spectral range set to 542-784 nm). Under identical excitation power, we measured a fluorescence brightness ratio \(B_{orange}/B_{crimson}=11.2\).
</p>

<p>If \(E_{tot}\) is the total energy absorbed by a bead, and \(E_{opt}\) is the total optical energy emitted by a bead, then the fluorescent efficiency \(\eta=E_{opt}/E_{tot}\). If the total energy absorbed by the bead is either optically emitted or transferred into heat energy \(H\), then we can solve for \(H\) in terms of \(E_{opt}\):

<div>
	$$\begin{equation} H=E_{tot}-E_{opt} = \frac{E_{opt}}{\eta}-E_{opt} = E_{opt}(\frac{1}{\eta}-1) \end{equation}$$
</div>

The total emitted optical energy \(E_{opt}\) is proportional to bead brightness \(B\), so:

<div>
	$$\begin{equation} H \propto B(\frac{1}{\eta}-1) \end{equation}$$
</div>

We can finally solve for \(H_{orange}/H_{crimson}\) at the same excitation power:

<div>
	$$\begin{equation} \frac{H_{orange}}{H_{crimson}} = \frac{B_{orange}(\frac{1}{\eta_{orange}}-1)}{B_{crimson}(\frac{1}{\eta_{crimson}}-1)} = 7.7 \end{equation}$$
</div>
</p>

<p>For the same excitation power, we estimate that orange beads will heat at a rate roughly eight times that of crimson beads. In order to heat orange beads at the same rate, we use one eighth of the crimson bead excitation power for our orange bead experiments (<a href="./index.html#Figure_4">Figure 4</a> and <a href="./index.html#Figure_5">Figure 5</a> with <code>Fluorescent sample type: Bead labeled with orange dye</code> selected).
</p>

<p>[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/j100334a023" title="Casey, Kelly G., and Edward L.

claims an uncertainty of 10% in their measured \(\Phi\) for Rhodamine B. If this were the only source of error in our measurements, we would expect the uncertainty in our estimate of \(H_{orange}/H_{crimson}\) to be 1%. If we propose an additional 5% uncertainty (2.5% standard deviation) to our measurements of \(\Phi_{crimson}\) and \(\Phi_{orange}\), as well as 10% uncertainty (5% standard deviation) in our measurement of \(B_{orange}/B_{crimson}\), we expect an uncertainty of 14% in our final estimate of \(H_{orange}/H_{crimson}\). By choosing to excite the orange beads with 1/8 of the laser power that we used to excite the crimson beads, we estimate that we heated the two bead types fairly similarly.

<h4>Dark field image acqusition details</h4></a>

<p>We perform dark-field imaging of excited fluorescent nanodiamonds in a setup outlined in the main article (<a href="./index.html#Figure_2">Figure 2b</a> with <code>Imaging method: Dark-field imaging of stimulated emission and scattered light</code> and <code>Fluorescent sample type: Nanodiamonds doped with N-v centers</code> selected). We illuminate the nanodiamonds with a train of several green excitation (532 nm) laser pulses as well as several pulses of red (721 nm) laser light in order to stimulate emission from the samples. We place a chrome disc in a back focal plane of the imaging path in order to block the transmitted stimulation light and allow the scattered light and stimulated emission to reach the camera. The excitation and stimulation laser pulses are always the same duration as each other, and they are typically 1.25 &micro;s (our shortest available duration). The excitation and stimulation trains have 600 &micro;s between pulses of the same color. Our experiments involve five sequential camera exposures:
</p>

<p>
<ol>
  <li>During the first exposure, the red pulse train precedes the green pulse train by 2.5 &micro;s. Because 600 &micro;s is much longer than the excitation lifetime, there should be no stimulated emission.</li>
  <li>During the second exposure, the red pulse train precedes the green pulse train by 1.25 &micro;s. The falling tails of the red pulses very slightly overlap with the rising edges of the green pulses, so a small amount of stimulated emission may be possible.</li>
  <li>During the third exposure, the red and green pulses are simultaneous. Stimulated emission should be possible.</li>
  <li>During the fourth exposure, the red pulse train follows the green pulse train by 1.25 &micro;s. The rising edges of the red pulses very slightly overlap with the falling tails of the green pulses, so a small amount of stimulated emission may be possible.</li>
  <li>During the fifth exposure, the green pulse train precedes the red pulse train by 2.5 &micro;s. Because 2.5 &micro;s is much longer than the excitation lifetime, there should be no stimulated emission. If the green pulse modifies the sample in a time-delayed fashion (e.g. heating) and this effect persists longer than 2.5 &micro;s, there may be some effect on the dark-field image.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>We additionally take a second five-exposure sequence with the green beam blocked. This a control for "crosstalk", a small effect of the green AOM operation on the red AOM transmission.
</p>

<a id="Dark_field_and_difference_image_processing" href="#Dark_field_and_difference_image_processing" target="_self">
<h4>Dark field and difference image processing</h4></a>

<p>The difference between the first and third exposure (of the five listed above) should let us know the effect of excitation on the phase contrast image of the beam. However, the stimulation laser intensity fluctuations are larger than the change due to excitation, so we typically take hundreds of five-exposure sequences and average the result to improve our sensitivity, and we also use the 4000-count coherent background to estimate stimulation laser brightness and re-scale the image. Because the sample moves over the time required to acquire all of the exposures, we employ image registration prior to averaging. (<strong>TODO: link to example figure generation code?</strong>) This is the image processing sequence that returns scattered light images that allow us to observe changes due to excitation:
</p>

<p>
<ol>
  <li>We estimate the average brightness of the red laser by averaging all dark-field images and then finding the mean pixel value of the regions of the image that do not contain the nanodiamond (the background).</li>
  <li>We estimate the brightness of the red laser in each exposure by finding the mean pixel value of the background of each exposure.</li>
  <li>We re-scale individual exposures by a factor of the ratio of the average background to the individual exposure background.</li>
  <li>We choose a nanodiamond image as the registration reference, and then register each scattered light image to the reference. Doing this well involves careful tuning of registration parameters.</li>
  <li>We average the scattered light images for each of the five excitation/stimulation delays.</li>
  <li>We compute "difference images": the difference between a particular scattered light image and the scattered light image when the stimulation pulse precedes excitation. We compute a second set of difference images in the case of the blocked green light, and subtract the "green blocked" from "green on" difference images to get the crosstalk-corrected difference image that accurately shows the change in scattering due to excitation.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>While we use 750x total magnification (8.7 nm/pixel) to give large dynamic range, this is not great for viewing our difference images, because intra-pixel fluctuations can appear to swamp the signal. Prior do displaying the scattered light and difference images of the nanodiamonds, we bin 8 x 8 regions of pixels to give a more typical size (69.6 nm/pixel).
</p>

<p>Figure A5a shows a sample scattered light image of a nanodiamond prior to excitation, and the change in that image before, during and after excitation, based on the experimental method and image processing steps delineated above. For each exposure, we used 25 maximum-intensity excitation/stimulation pulse pairs, and the images are a 200-exposure average.

<h3>Estimating the phase between stimulated emission and scattering</h3></a>

<p>The results in <a href="./index.html#Figure_6">Figure 6</a> suggest that stimulated emission from a nanodiamond makes the scattered light image darker. This could happen if the scattered electric field destructively interferes with the stimulated emission electric field. Interference is possible because both stimulated emission and scattered light are coherent with the incident electric field, and therefore have a distinct phase relationship with each other.
</p>

<p>To predict this phase relationship, we start with incident electric field \(E_0e^{i\omega t + \phi_0}\), stimulated emission field \(E_{stim}e^{i\omega t + \phi_{stim}}\), and scattered field \(E_{scat}e^{i\omega t + \phi_{scat}}\). Because stimulated emission is considered a nearly instantaneous process

there is no delay between the incident electric field  and the stimulated emission electric field:

and larger delay for light scattered by particles that do not have a sufficiently small diameter for the Rayleigh approximation \(d\ll \frac{\lambda}{\pi}\), so:
<div>
	$$\begin{equation}\phi_{scat} - \phi_0 \ge \frac{\pi}{2} \end{equation}$$
</div>
Our diameter \(d\sim 80\,nm\) nanodiamonds are slightly larger than the small diameter approximation allows for \(\lambda=721\,nm\). To estimate the additional refractive phase shift, we note that the refractive index of diamond \(n_{diamond}=2.42\), while the mounting medium \(n_{oil}=1.52\), with a difference \(\Delta n_{refractive}=0.9\). The approximate phase difference due to different refractive optical path lengths is:
<div>
	$$\begin{equation}\Delta\phi_{refractive} \sim \frac{2\pi d\Delta n_{refractive}}{\lambda} \approx 0.6 \end{equation}$$

We can then estimate the relative phase between scattered light and stimulated emission:

<p>Another way to confirm that the change in scattered light signal depends on both excitation and stimulation intensity is to use longer laser pulses while keeping the pulse energy constant. In the unsaturated regime, both excitation and stimulation rates are intensity-dependent, whereas total fluorescence is energy-dependent. Figure A7 below shows the change in scattering of a nanodiamond due to simultaneous excitation and stimulation pulses of 5 &micro;s, 3.75 &micro;s, 2.5 &micro;s and 1.25 &micro;s with the instensity tuned so that the total energy per pulse (and average power) is the same for all pulse lengths. Each scattered light image was taken using 30 excitation/stimulation pulse pairs per exposure, and the difference images shown are generated by subtracting 200 exposure average of images taken without simultaneous excitation/stimulation from images with simultaneous excitation/stimulation.

<p>The difference image signal monotonically increases with increasing laser intensity, even though the delivered energy is the same for all pulse lengths. This behavior, which is starkly unlike fluorescence, is not unique to stimulated emission; photothermal imaging is also intensity-dependent. Regardless, we similarly performed phase contrast imaging of four index-matched crimson beads using excitation/stimulation pulse pairs with 10 &micro;s, 5 &micro;s, 2.5 &micro;s, and 1.25 &micro;s duration (we used a different bead for each pulse length to avoid photobleaching effects). Each phase contrast image was taken with eight excitation/stimulation pulse pairs per exposure with a phase plate angle set to maximize the contrast of the difference images. The difference images are generated by subtracting 50-exposure averages of the phase contrast images without simultaneous excitation/excitation from images with simultaneous excitation/stimulation. We found that, as with the nanodiamond, the crimson bead difference image signal magnitude increased monotonically for increasing excitation and stimulation intensity (see results in Figure A8 below).

<h3>Controls for thermal effects due to the excitation laser</h3></a>

<p>In order to confirm that the change we observe in the 721 nm wavelength phase contrast and darkfield images are due to coherent interference with stimulated emission, we had to rule out other possible effects of the excitation laser pulse on the red image (comprised of the transmitted stimulating beam, scattered light, and stimulated emission). Stimulated emission is a fast process; it may emit from a fluorophore as long as it is in the excited state, which normally persists just nanoseconds after the excitation energy is shut off.
</p>

<p>Fast heating of our samples is a different possible explanation of the change in our phase contrast and dark-field images: the pulsed laser excitation could be absorbed by the fluorophores, and the absorbed energy could be converted into heat. A local change in temperature of the sample could change the size or refractive index of the bead or nanodiamond with respect to the surrounding media. This, in turn, would change the scattering properties of the sample and alter the scattered light image. In fact, this effect is the foundation of photothermal imaging

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.5.000377" title="Boccara, A. C., D. Fournier, Warren Jackson, and Nabil M. Amer. &quot;Sensitive photothermal deflection technique for measuring absorption in optically thin media.&quot; Optics Letters 5, no. 9 (1980): 377-379.">Boccara 1980</a>].

The fluorescent samples would have excitation-altered scattering properties for as much time as it takes for heat to diffuse away from the area around an emitter. This time scale \(1/\omega_s\) is typically on the order of microseconds for organic materials

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1073765" title="Boyer, David, Philippe Tamarat, Abdelhamid Maali, Brahim Lounis, and Michel Orrit. &quot;Photothermal imaging of nanometer-sized metal particles among scatterers.&quot; Science 297, no. 5584 (2002): 1160-1163.">Boyer 2002</a>],

where \(\omega_s=2 \kappa C^{-1}R_s^{-2}\) (\(R_s\) is the minimum resolvable distance of the imaging system, and \(\kappa\) and \(C\) are the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of the mounting medium, respectively). For reasonable estimates of the parameters in this relationship (\(\kappa\approx0.2\frac{W}{mK}\) and \(C\approx2\frac{J}{Kcm^3}\)), we predict that a photothermal image of our sample should persist roughly 0.8 &micro;s after the excitation laser has been turned off.
</p>

<p>The 0.5 V/&micro;s unity gain slew rate of the <a href="#buffer_amp" target="_self">buffer amplifier</a> we use to send the appropriate current to our <a href="#AOM" target="_self">acousto-optic modulator</a> drivers  forces us to drive our <a href="#analog_out_card" target="_self">analog out card</a> at a maximum of 0.8 MHz, which  means that 1.25 &micro;s is the shortest attainable duration for our excitation and stimulation laser pulses. In order to make observations with the highest available time resolution, in our imaging experiments, we typically use minimum available excitation and stimulation laser pulse duration. We do not observe any time-delayed effects of the excitation pulse in those images. As is evident in the time-delayed images in the <a href="#Phase_contrast_image_generation" target="_self">phase contrast image generation</a> and <a href="#Dark-field_image_generation" target="_self">dark-field image generation</a> sections, the changes in the images due to excitation do not appear to persist longer than the 1.25 &micro;s excitation laser pulse duration. While the lack of microsecond-delayed signal is encouraging, we note that because the minimum laser pulse duration is similar to our rough estimation of the duration of a photothermal signal, it is possible that we may not be able to discern some photothermal signals from stimulated emission in our current optical setup.
</p>

<p/>We did manage to observe some apparant sample heating in phase contrast imaging mode of the nanodiamonds (main article Figure 2b with <code>Imaging method: Phase contrast imaging of stimulated emission and scattered light</code> and <code>Fluorescent sample type: Nanodiamonds doped with N-v centers</code> selected) when we increased the duration of the excitation laser pulse by a factor of 20 (25 microseconds) while maintaining the same peak excitation intensity. When we delayed the stimulation laser pulse with reference to the longer and more energetic excitation pulse, we observed a change in brightness of the main lobe of the phase contrast image of the nanodiamond that persisted for milliseconds after the end of the excitation pulse (Figure A6, red solid line). We also observed that the total brightness of the coherent background similarly changed, though to a lesser degree (Figure A6, red dashed line). For each exposure, we used one 25 &micro;s excitation laser pulse and one 5 &micro;s stimulation laser pulse with fixed relative pulse delay. At each pulse delay, we took 50 exposures. The stimulation pulse delays ranged from 0 to over 5 milliseconds of time after the excitation pulse. Each data point in Figure A6 represents a change in image brightness from at a single delay averaged over 50 exposures.

The red pulse forms a phase contrast image whose brightness in the main image lobe (red solid line) varies depending on the green/red pulse delay. Each point on the graph is the average change in brighness per pixel of the main lobe of a 50-exposure average of red phase contrast images. The inset images correspond to individual early, middle and late delays after the onset of the 20 &micro;s green pulse (green line).

<p>Unlike the signal we attribute to stimulated emission that appears in the data in the main article, the phase contrast image signal peaks 250 &micro;s after the end of the excitation pulse and decays to 1/e of the peak in ~ 1.7 ms. The signal contrast is maximized when the scattered light signal contrast is minimized, meaning that the apparent phase difference between light scattered by the nanodiamond and the time-delayed change in scattered light is 90&deg; &plusmn; 10&deg;. According to the heat diffusion equation we cited earlier in this section, we would expect microsecond and not millisecond duration cooling from a sub-diffraction-sized particle embedded in immersion oil. The long cooling timescale and the fact that the background brightness of the phase contrast image also changed suggest that the excitation laser may have been heating a larger area of the sample&mdash;perhaps the entire illuminated area. This result further encouraged us to avoid the long pulsed excitation regime in our search for stimulated emission images.

<h3>Phase contrast imaging of an excited fluorescent nanodiamond</h3></a>

<p>In the main article, we showed how we used <a href="./index.html##Dark-field_imaging_nanodiamonds">dark-field imaging</a>, and not phase contrast imaging, to attempt to image stimulated emission from fluorescent nanodiamonds. These nanodiamonds are not an ideal candidate for phase contrast imaging of stimulated emission. Their extremely high refractive index (2.42) prevents index-matching and yields bright, coherent scattering. Given our experimental parameters, the stimulating light that is scattered by a nanodiamond can fill the dynamic range of our camera in less than 40 &micro;s. The power of the elastically scattered light dominates that of the nanodiamond fluorescence by a factor of ~6,000:1. Given the ~10% depletion measured, we extrapolate that the scattered light intensity would dominate stimulated emission intensity by ~60,000:1. While phase contrast imaging could boost stimulated emission signal by interference with a coherent background, the scattered light is also coherent, and the magnitude of the interference term between the transmitted light background and the scattered light would still dominate that between transmitted light and stimulated emission. As such, we expect that, even with phase contrast imaging, any stimulated emission from the nanodiamonds would be visible only as a small perturbation of the scattered light signal (similar to our <a href="./index.html#Figure_6">dark-field results</a>). Regardless, we performed phase contrast imaging of excited nanodiamonds (<a href="./index.html#Figure_2">Figure 2b</a> in the main article with <code>Imaging method: Phase contrast imaging of stimulated emission and scattered light</code> and <code>Fluorescent sample type: Nanodiamonds doped with N-v centers</code> selected) to confirm this expectation.
</p>

<p>In this experiment, we took advantage of the fact that our nanodiamonds do not bleach and took many phase contrast images of our nanodiamond samples with a fine scan of phase plate angles. The 32 phase plate angles were separated in steps of 0.2&deg;, over a total range of 6.2&deg;. The angle of the phase plate maps nonlinearly onto the relative phase angle between transmitted light and scattered light, resulting in an average optical phase shift of ~14&deg; for each phase plate step. At each phase plate angle, we took five exposures with different relative delays between excitation and stimulation pulses: \(\Delta\tau\) = -2.5 &micro;s, -1.25 &micro;s, 0 &micro;s, 1.25 &micro;s, and 2.5 &micro;s. We repeated this sequence 1000 times for each phase plate angle. During each exposure, two 1.25 &micro;s duration excitation and stimulation pulse pairs were incident on the camera with 600 &micro;s delay between each pair. In between exposures, a constant stream of 1.25 &micro;s excitation pulses illuminated the camera with 600 &micro;s inter-pulse spacing in order to maintain thermal stability of the sample, though we did not detect any sample heating artifacts using these laser exposure parameters. Figure A9 below shows the results of this experiment.

<p>A phase contrast image of light scattered from a nanodiamond is in the upper panel of Figure A9. This image is an average of the nearly 1000 exposures taken when the stimulation laser pulse preceded the excitation pulse by 2.5 &micro;s at a single phase plate angle ("nearly 1000" because we ignored exposures during which a dust particle entered the emission beam path). The lower panel of Figure A9 shows a difference image: the difference between the 1000 exposure average of the phase contrast image with simultaneous stimulation and excitation pulses versus the corresponding image in the above panel. By adjusting the phase plate angle (Figure A9 with <code>Phase plate position #: 0-31</code> selected) we observe that the maximum negative contrast of the difference image corresponds with the maximum positive contrast image of the scattered light, and vice versa. As with the darkfield measurement, the phase contrast difference image appears to resemble a decrease in the magnitude of scattered light due to coincident excitation and stimulation. The phase contrast technique did not appear to provide further information about stimulated emission from fluorescent nanodiamonds.

<h3>Axial view of fluorescence from a nanodiamond doped with N-v centers</h3></a>

<p>The fluorescence plot in <a href="./index.html#Figure_5">Figure 5 (inset)</a> in the main text shows transverse (XY) in-focus views of the fluorescence from crimson and orange beads, as well as from a nanodiamond doped with N-v centers. Figure A4 below shows an axial (XZ) projection of a stack of fluorescence images taken with varying axial position of the nanodiamond relative to focus. Also shown is the axial projection of the change in fluorescence due to stimulated emission depletion. The images used to generate the axial projection were taken in 200 nm axial steps. There were 700 excitation/stimulation pulse pairs during each exposure, with 600 &micro;s between each pair. Each z slice in the figure is generated by averaging 20 such exposures at a single axial position and then simply averaging over the vertical dimension. We were able to generate such a projection due to the absence of photobleaching in N-v centers. Collecting the required number of fluorescence images from crimson or orange beads to make a similar axial projection is complicated by photobleaching of those dyes.

After we finished drawing all of the frames, we saved the presentation in an html format (available using <code>File > Save As</code>). This action generates an individual png file for each frame (ancillary files are also generated; these may be ignored or deleted). We then ran a python script that uses
