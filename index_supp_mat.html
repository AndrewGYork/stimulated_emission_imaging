<p class="abstract">We demonstrate experimental proof that stimulated emission is distinguishable from the stimulating beam. It has a point-like PSF (point spread function) and coherently interacts with the stimulating beam.</p>


<p>We also rule out heating of the sample due to the excitation laser. In principle, sufficiently powerful excitation light could preferentially heat either the nanodiamond or the surrounding medium, causing a shape change that would subtly alter the amount of scattered light observed. Such a thermal effect on scattering should persist long (7 milliseconds?) after the microsecond duration excitation pulses [see supp mat for thermal effects]. In the control measurement where the stimulating pulse is delayed microseconds after the excitation pulse, the decrease in brightness of the scattered light disappears [supp mat or new figure?]. It is unlikely that the excitation pulse is thermally modulating the scattered light image.

<p>[Placeholder - constant energy pulse length scan. For  now, I don't think it's necessary. It is evocative though. Reminder to show Andy comparison with simulation.]

<p>[Should we even show phase contrast images of STE in nanodiamonds? I've included them for now here.] Figure S3 shows phase contrast images of a N-v center-doped nanodiamonds, and the brightness change of the image when the N-v centers are excited, for multiple angles of the phase plate. [acquisition parameters]. The results resemble the dark-field measurement; the scattered light signal magnitude decreases when the N-v centers are excited. When the phase plate is tilted so that the scattered light from the nanodiamond constructively interferes with the transmitted light, the nanodiamond appears to be a bright spot on the transmitted light background. In this case, when the excitation beam is turned on, the nanodiamond brightness decreases. When the phase plate angle is tuned until the nanodiamond appears to be a dark spot on the transmitted light background (destructive interference) and the excitation beam is turned on, the dark spot appears less dark. [include acquisition parameters here]

<figcaption><strong>Figure S3: Phase contrast nanodiamond image and stimulated emission signal.</strong> Scale bar: 250 nm. This figure's images were generated by <code>/figure_generation/figure_S3.py</code>. </figcaption>

<p>Nanodiamonds doped with N-v centers are not an ideal candidate for phase contrast imaging of stimulated emission. In dark-field imaging of the nanodiamonds, the magnitude of the elastically scattered light dominates that of the signal we hope to be stimulated emission. The scattered light is coherent, so in phase contrast imaging, the magnitude of the interference term between the transmitted light background and the scattered light would still dominate that between transmitted light and stimulated emission. As with the dark-field results discussed earlier, any stimulated emission would be visible only as a small perturbation of the scattered light signal.
</p>

<p>One way to minimize scattered light without decreasing stimulated emission is to match the refractive index of the mounting medium to that of the fluorescent objects. Index matching media are not readily available for diamond particles, but off-the-shelf matching media [meltmount reference] are available for lower-index imaging standards such as polystyrene beads (n &asymp; 1.6). We used the above described phase contrast imaging system to empirically determine the fractional mixture of different mounting media to minimize scattered light from polystyrene beads infused with crimson fluorescent dye (please see supp mat for procedure). We then measured phase contrast images of the index-matched beads. In Figure 7, we show the image that appeared on top of the transmitted light background only when the N-v centers were excited. We tilted the phase plate to two angles that maximally enhanced the signal contrast, one of which caused the sign of the signal to reverse. The phase contrast images are taken with 5 simultaneous stimulation and excitation laser pulses, each at peak intensity with 1-&mu;s duration, over a 4 ms camera exposure. The displayed images are an average of two camera exposures.
